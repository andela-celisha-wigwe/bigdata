For the past month or so, however, I've been wondering to myself, \"What have you gotten yourself into?!\"  In an effort to get the spring back in my step, I devoted part of my &lt;a href=\"http://blog.myspace.com/www.amazon.com\" target=\"_self\">Amazon&lt;/a> Christmas gift certificates to purchase &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1570281823/sr=1-1/qid=1138157014/ref=sr_1_1/103-1392856-5660608?_encoding=UTF8\" target=\"_self\">this&lt;/a>.

Cool, huh?)&lt;br />&lt;br />Anyway, the book suggested running without wearing a watch and leaving the headphones at home.  These are two crutches I've been very dependent on!  But, for my shorter week-day run this evening, I decided to try it without music.  I also couldn't find my watch, so I ran without that too.  The results were amazing!  I ran faster, I got annoyed whenever I had to stop for traffic lights, I enjoyed myself much more, and I when I got home I just wanted to keep running.  Rather than running for a set amount of time, and counting down the minutes until I could stop, I just ran to the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/linc/\" target=\"_self\">Lincoln Memorial&lt;/a> and back home.  That's five-point-six miles according to &lt;a href=\"http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/\" target=\"_self\">G-map Pedometer&lt;/a>.  (&lt;a href=\"http://maps.google.com/\" target=\"_self\">Google Maps&lt;/a> is the best.  True that!  Double True!) &lt;br />&lt;br />For the first time in awhile, I'm actually looking forward to my long run this Sunday.  16 miles this time!"},

We tried the Blue Elephant Restaurant then...there were a lot of groans of dismay from folks as most people did not seem to enjoy Thai food. I love spicy food so I had no complaints.&lt;br />&lt;br />As I strolled through the restaurant it became obvious that much time and money has been poured into creating the exotic ambiance, which seems to cleverly cater just as much for romantic couples as it does for large upmarket office crowds.&lt;br />&lt;br />I had a cocktail called - Miss Siam which iis basically Coconut flesh, Coconut water, Skyy vanilla, Passion fruit liqueur. It was good.&lt;br />&lt;br />Having studied the extensive menu for ten minutes and still not chosen, the group decided to opt for the Royal Thai Banquet with soup (\u00a339 per person), washed down by a reasonably priced bottle of Pinot Blanc and Merlot. And we were not disappointed by our choice. Starters included the regular mixture of Paper Prawns, Fish Cakes, Dim Sum, Satay and Spring rolls followed by a beautifully spicy Tom Yum soup. However, I would have liked slightly more time to digest the starters so that I could fully appreciate the six main courses; this banquet really is not for those with a small appetite! The Emerald Chicken and Green Curry really stood out for me, as well as the Ped Makaram, tender duck slices with a tamarind sauce. The Fresh Black Pepper Tiger Prawn were tender and delicious but the lamb Massaman was strictly OK.By the time the desserts arrived, I was filled to the brim! However I felt I had had a truly wonderful dining experience, and look forward to my next trip to the Blue Elephant. I know my travel companions from the U.S would beg to differ ;)"},

We had the Meze (appetizers) Calamari and Shawarma...it was really good...especially the Calamari ( umm...folks at that point in time I had no idea what Calamari was and my only exposure to meat was Chicken,Goat, Fish and umm chicken....).&lt;br />&lt;br />I had the Ouzi which was spicy lamb in a pilaf with a Yogurt Side...doesn't sound appealing but was really good. Lamb is a more chewier version of goat meat....I still prefer goat meat anyday...but this lamb had been marinated in wonderful spices and stewed to perfection.&lt;br />&lt;br />I think if we would have stopped with Meze and the entrees we would have been GOOD...well no we had this friend in the group let me call him \"S\" who was out to impress the B'Day girl...so the finest bottle of wine was shared...some Lebanese wine (all I remember is it was 50 bucks a bottle)...ok..ok so I am cheap :)&lt;br />&lt;br />The dinner was mellow and the company friendly....a experience to be repeated. Do try Lebanese Taverna..if you in the DC area and in the mood for Middle Eastern Food."},

Quite a bit has changed in the last 5 months, that's for goddamn sure.&lt;br />&lt;br />Well, I've been at work officially for over a year now, and I'm still not insane! While Christmas time was fairly hectic, it certainly was survivable, although unpleasant. I suppose the only thing I learned from it is just how goddamn dumb Christmas really is. There were days where I'd accumulate $6000 in my register alone. That's almost a thousand dollars an hour from customers who shouldn't be spending that much and who I doubt have the money anyway. Thanks to the advent of credit cards, it's never been easier to spend money that you don't have! I mean shit, take that $500 of clothes and instead of feeling happy that you spent your money, give it to a family who would be happy to have it in the first place.&lt;br />&lt;br />money-spending+items doesn't equal happiness. Pretty simple really.&lt;br />&lt;br />Anyway, while I used to hate pretty much everyone at work, I'm on good terms with each and every one of them. This Christmas took out the two main targets for some reason, and as such, work is actually pretty cool now. Aside from the puny amount of shifts I've been getting lately, but that's a symptom of the moarket and not the atmosphere. At least I hope."},

It is great out side, sitting on the bench under the trees with a nice cool breeze during a sunny, no cloud day.  It is great, i will do this more often.  I dont no how to explain this feeling, it is great, i love it.  The router, i paid $50 for off of ebay, the boosters were made using fruity pebbles ceral box and alluminum foil.  anyway, getting to other stuff, tomorrow i have to go to work, and then monday i go back to college.  Yes, im going to school during the summer.  i wish i did not have too, but i will graduate quicker, and i only have to go to college 3 times a week.  I enjoy my college, it is pretty good, tachers are nice, the school has top of the line powerMacs, at least most of the rooms.  I saw some G5s in the MIS office, i hope they set them up soon, i cant wait.  Also, i bug them to set up wi fi every day that i can.  but the signal strength is low.  AHHHH they never listen to others, they just think they no what to do.  they stupidly set up 802.11g, it can handle a lot of data, but it does not reach far, they should of installed 802.11b, like i have, I just explained how far mine went.  oh well, enough for my first time.  hope you all enjoyed my blogg, more to coem. ^_^"},

I know relegion is a touchy thing, but my opionin is that people use religion as a means to solve the problems that have with themselves, a self help line really. It's hard to explain without sounding really screwed up, but i beleive in religion becuase i know that its the natural way for a human to cope with the hardships of life and it actually is helpful to me ina a ton of ways, but i dont really beleive in a god. I also beleive the bible is a story, A STORY, not a historal or holy document. Its created to help people, its a source of socail codes and a way to forgive themselves for sins. Unforunatly its also a politicail tool, it was re-written many times before it was finallized into the canan (in the third century... so ha dont call me ignorant about this stuff) and re-intpreted to allow for unchallegned rule of kings, invasions and crusades (yes even iraq in a way, not to mention those crusades started the grudge that led to 9/11 leading to the war in iraq.. its all a big circle), the improtance of men in a household, and the prosecution of gays, blacks and any other religion still seem like a holy document? Even today people use religion to excuse all kinds of things, like bush with the war, take for example \"christains for the death penalty\", if they called themselves \"upper white class citzens with no criminal record or chance of being arrested for the death penalty and against the tax pressure of prison\" then it would seem cruel, but if their christian.. then ok, as long as its in the name of christ... U REALLY THIBK CHRIST IS FOR THE DEATH PENALTY?!?! id say he got the short end of that stick in his day!!! I mean read the bible, i think \"dont kill\" is a pretty clear commandment, or love thine enemies... same for the christains for the war.... how do u miss that?!?! Either way.. back to my orginail piont, religion is a self help line. and should be treated as such... u never hear from the \"pyschic phill hotliners for the war\" becuase its not a way of life its a way to cope with it...

I started second this time then had an awful start. Further in the back, though, two karts locked wheels, and on went flying. It was the number 66 of Kyle Fittro. His kart started to do back flips through the air after he fell out from the initial contact. He had a scraped wrist but other than that he was fine. When the red flags started flying, the three karts in front of me kept on racing. I decided to slow down since it was a red flag and while that happened some of the more stupid kids decided to pass everyone. It took about ten minutes to get everything figured out. Once we started up again I fell back to third. One lap later I got passed on the straight. There was some kid who kept on trying to pass me on the straight but never could do it. I finished fourth in the heat race. After everyone else finished their heat races it was time for the mains. I had, for once, a great start for my main, still in fourth, but catching up to the guy infront of me. I was much faster than everyone in the infield, but once I got to the straight my engine let me down. After a while they still pulled away and I wasn't in their draft. I could of swore the was the number 61 of Matt Jackson trying to pass me but after the race my dad told me that he was actually pretty far back. I had to settle for fourth, which is still great. It was my fifth straight trophy. I can't wait until next race."},

In the US, first class mail will take anywhere for 1 to 5 days to arrive at it's destination, and there's a reasonable chance it'll be longer or get lost. So you have to employ a private company for guaranteed overnight delivery at $15.00 or so. Here, first class mail will be delivered the next day, for I think 28p (or maybe $0.50). And I haven't had anything lost yet. I like that."},

It's only quaint for the first day or so, then it becomes downright inconvenient. In the wintertime with daily rain and little heat to evaporate the damp clothes, we resorted to a dehumidifier and a radiator turned as high as it could go. It still took 2 full days to dry out your clothes with this method. In arid, desert prone california, everyone has a clothes dryer, when it would take only 2 hours to dry out on a line. Weird."},

Mine is no exception he has all three.  Today the dog (Keb-Mo) learned more about these gadgets than he would have liked.  Keb is a 126lb dog that lives inside with us.  He is a big baby, loves everyone and would not hurt a fly, but sometimes I get tied up at work and can not get free to walk him like I should.  He has grown acustomed to controlling his bladder very well, but every so often he does it in the house.  Today I came in early but I got a telephone call.  Keb was doing his get me out to pee dance, but I could not get off of the telephone call.  He left the room, shortly there after I heard a loud explosion type of sound, the dog flew through the air, hit the wall, and let out a blood curling yelp.  As I ran to see what had happened it was very clear.  Since he had to go very badly and I did not take him out he went to the nearist room, my sons, and pee'ed on the TV.  He did it on the side where the air vents are.  Needless to say he shorted out the tv and he got a very big shock.  The dog is alright, eventhough he may be even better potty trained than before.  The TV is fried, and I am sure Wal-Mart will not trade it for a new one.  Oh well no harm just one TV, and Keb Mo got a real leson in electricity."},

It is possible to take a simple idea and create a huge success. We think people who accomplish this work hard or have others to support them. We believe they are smarter, richer or in some way more endowed than we are. What we cannot see and do not measure is people's attitudes about what they do. Success begins with a positive attitude; it is the most valuable asset we may own. The people at the top did not fall there. They were willing to do whatever it took, taking the ups and the downs, asking for what they really wanted and staying focused until they got it. Success is not bought or inherited. It is a product of what we put out. Success begins with a good feeling about where we are and a positive attitude about where we want to be.     "},

I love how everything comes back, but my impatiance for waiting sometimes gets the best of me. when the trees have grown their buds, and shade can be cast by their leaves, then it's summer. It's only spring when the all the trees are budding. Flowers are always pre-mature in my mind. As the scouts to spring they bring hope that life will come again, but at some point are snowed on. My true memory of summer are the hot days on the lake, sailing in yet another regatta that my father made me do. Sliding my hand through the warm water I watch the path of air and fingers cut through something very much tangable, and yet not even real. At the moment clouds cover the sky, the potentail of rain exsists, but in this dry climate without the smell of ozone there's all but a small chance of rain. "},

Each of them invading NewPort in their own little way!  D.J. has gotten a hold of the sobby and vulnerable Marissa, Lindsay has brought fun into Ryan's life, Zach has been keeping Summer Vibing on High Frequencies, and Alex is taking control of Seth(who actually has been needing someone to do that for a while!)!  So how do you all feel about \"The New Kids On The Block?\"  Like'em or Hate'em, seems that they will be around for a while!  But I feel as if there is something in each of these characters that hasn't been let out yet!  We have Zach, who seems to be the perfect guy but most of the time if someone is too good to be true they usually are!  Same with the other's really, there is no way they could be exactly what Ryan, Marrissa, Seth, and Summer need without having luggage!  I mean this is \"NewPort\" we are talking about!  so if you all have any hunches or anything just post a comment and let everyone know what you think about the \"Move In\" by \"The New Kids On The Block\"!

I am 17 (will be 18 in July), I just recently Graduated High School (Thank God) and I have no plans for my future.  I work monday through Friday's from 8-4 at a Shell station called Stop-N-Shop.  It's not glamorous but the pay is good, and sometimes it can be fun.  I used to watch \"The O.C.\"  every Wednsday night but since the Finale I have been rewinding through past episodes that made me laugh, cry, and sometimes even flip upside down while trying to wrestle my pillow into a pin when Oliver broke Ryan and Marissa up.  (God I hate that guy)  Any-hoo, I am hoping that in time this will become a great \"BlogSpot\", if not, well hey, I never actually said it WOULD be good.  If you want to E-mail me Comments or just to say hey, or anything at all my E-mail is TheOCFan@comcast.net.  I will be posting daily if not numerously-daily.  so have fun and I will O.C.....ya later!  (Corny)  B-Man Out!&lt;/strong>"},

Jill knows I can't write under pressure, and I hope I have driven the point sufficiently straightly home by obstinately refusing to add even a single byte of my written voice to this blog, over a period spanning approximately two years, without having felt even the slightest twinge of shame. I have held out against everything ranging from minor threats to major bouts of unconcern, never wavering. But today things change. Starting today I am going to write 500-ish words a day-ish and at the bidding of my own free will.&lt;br />&lt;br />Wow, that's 118 words already till the dot at the end of this line.&lt;br />&lt;br />Today I shall introduce myself, remaining as superficial as possible. No Sir! No soul searching for me! What I write will, I hope, set the pace of things to come.&lt;br />&lt;br />Mahesh was astounded. Mahesh was stunned. Mahesh brandished a Tommy Gun - Ed. Twenty seven shots were fired into the silent night, as four of the five bulky torsos, attached to swaying, knife wielding limbs, making threatening gestures, were neatly chopped into quarts. It was dark and quite. Mahesh was shocked. Mahesh dropped the gun and it fell to the ground making disagreeing noises. Mahesh began to run. It was time for dinner.&lt;br />&lt;br />Dinner begins at half past eight. The house is clean and brightly lit. Soft music is floating in the air. Mahesh is seated at the head of the table. The little kid sits directly opposite him but does not look at Mahesh. He is looking over his right shoulder at a Television screen. There is soup and peas mixed together on the table. The little kid gets up and changes the channel on the television. The bright lights suddenly change character. Dark rock music engulfs the room. The lights dance around the room in rapidly changing hues. There is no peace on earth, even inside of a man\u2019s house. There is a shotgun on the table - Dark, solid and comforting. Mahesh squeezes his arms around the shotgun and it goes off. There is silence once more. The infernal music is still playing.&lt;br />&lt;br />The little kid was stunned. There was blood in his soup and there was blood on the Television screen. He ran out of the room screaming for help. Two strong bulky hands descended on him at the door and the screaming stopped almost immediately. The fifth had found him. Things were never easy for Mahesh. He always had to fight for his life, but he had always won. Mahesh was invincible and things would remain the same today. He grabbed the right hand of the fifth and spun him around. There was no gun, none was needed. He pushed a knee into his guts. Then twisted his right wrist with an extended palm while simultaneously head butting him into the jaw, breaking it. As the fifth fell, he grabbed his neck and rotated it easily, almost effortlessly."},

No mail, no queries, no enhancements, no pending work\u2026 so far. Just 7 days away from completing 1 full year in Infosys makes me as excited as adding one year- every year to my age.&lt;br />This is the right day for me to remember and pen down the beautiful year that just few by leaving behind some scented petals.&lt;br />Memories of year 1:&lt;br />Just a few days of rest after the college life for few and a big leap from a small company for others, the journey into the heaven scented land of Mysore began. There is no better place to start his career than Infosys, to add to it, Mysore Infy. I can still feel the excitement, enthusiasm and bliss everyone had on 15th of March 05. In the vast campus with some big buildings and motherly maintained greenery added to the excitement.&lt;br />Some carried the work experience with them and many were still kids, Infy took the responsibility to bring them all to the same level, 1 year later I feel they were quite successful. A mentor as old in Infy as we were took the reigns of driving the 180 people wagon through 120 days. He had a special charm, the ability to convince people with a \u2018no\u2019 added with a naughty smile \u2013 Sujith. He did more than what we expected to make the journey smooth.&lt;br />&lt;br />The days of the college were back: books, tests, exams, results, library, and night-outs. The josh for people to study picked up as compre-started nearing. Tests were minor hiccups which impacted more in the beginning but were restricted only to book-bugs later on.&lt;br />It would be a crime on not to mention on how the days were spent in the luxurious hostel. Rs.50/day for it was not even sufficient for the daily smile of the care-taker of the rooms.&lt;br />Waking up at 7, switching on the TV on full volume, barging into the bathroom to freshen up, calling up Akhi, Shreyas, karthik too meet for breakfast, fighting for which row to sit in the class, cribbing on the same old menu, planning for an outing, coming back into the room, switching on the AC in full power \u2013 having a feel of the Arctic\u2019s, calling all the numbers in the telephone book, planning on which channel to watch, joining in again for dinner, lazy walk back to the hostel from the caf\u00e9, snehanshu\u2019s love stories, chat with Arko, Kanta, Bajpai, Siju, Anirudh, Narahari late in the nights sometimes on the rooftop and striking the bed thinking about the new friends you made. Well did I ever mention studies? Oh ya\u2026 that to was sometimes cramped into the daily fun-itinerary. Smoking restriction in the rooms brought out some fun filled days between Kanta and Ashwarya. I still cannot forget some wonderful moments spent on the stair-case of the hostels along with some entertainment stunts from Arijith. Cannot even forget the enjoyable trouble Ramesh n Anand gave with their particular \u2018requirements\u2019. There are many I have missed out but be sure I haven\u2019t forgotten any, not even the afghan dress of Priya or the string slippers of deepika for which I pulled their legs like crazy.&lt;br />&lt;br />Other than the resort err. Infy campus the time spent in Chamundi Hills, eating Mallige Idli\u2019s, wiling away time in the go-carting tracks, the travel from the remote infy campus to the city, ride on bikes, going in big groups- how they race through my mind leaving the trace of smile on my face.&lt;br />&lt;br />4 months in Mysore, the trip back home was one of the most cherished moments. The games we enjoyed in train with colleagues trying to out beat each other, the best of dumb-charades from Deepika, sleepy Soumya &amp; Shreyas, chirpy Priya n Chaitra, noisy Nidhi, silent but witty Akhi, the politically \u2018wrong\u2019 Kanta, the amazing technical discussions with Shaz n Karthik, the great drives in my car and of course \u2018one\u2019 most memorable turn, man I miss them a lot.&lt;br />&lt;br />Finally came the compre, the results brought shock n surprise to many, including me. I had no hopes to clear it. But the result was such that it found me wanting just 2 marks more to hit the \u2018A\u2019 mark.  But I was through, like many more\u2026 that\u2019s what most of them wanted anyway.&lt;br />&lt;br />The value of the time spent in Mysore was mainly felt when we were all parting ways to give back on what was spent on us by Infy. Tears rolled with the feeling that we might not see the people again with whom we spent the best parts of our lives. Messenger and mails would keep us together\u2026 even this faded out as the year went by.&lt;br />&lt;br />Training was over; finally, I was happy to be back in Bangalore with parents and friends. EISA it was, the department I would report to. The excitement to work there was short lived. I was desperate to change and fortunately moved over to the Banking domain. A fresher like me was graciously absorbed into the team. Raghu and Shwetha took pains to impart the procedures followed here, and of course taught the ever so confusing Directory structure of Finacle and complex vi editor. Then the usual monotonous work started, enhancing the tools and supporting them became a usual routine. Good work comes regularly but is short lived. Excitement in life now is just a bigger pay cheque and fatter perks.&lt;br />&lt;br />It was a wonderful journey. Passed though one of the most wonderful stations with probably the best people."},

I went to Outback for lunch today and I am EXTREMELY proud of myself. I hardly ate any sour cream (and no butter). They also have a very tasty fat free tomato dressing.

I have limited my fat intake and I think that is making me feel better.  Also, since my stomach is not stuffed when I go to bed, I think I have actually been sleeping better. I have made good choices all this week and for that I am happy. Last Sunday, I think I mentioned that I had a food meltdown \u2013 an all you can eat buffet brunch and a high fat dinner. But I don\u2019t think one day is going to ruin my week. I think I will still end up loosing some weight this week if I continue to make good choices. I did indulge today and have meatloaf with mashed potatoes for lunch, but I used some of my flex points so I think it will all work out.  "},

I predict that demand for both the Thruxton and the Rocket III will continue to grow through the summer as more and more of the Triumph faithful get a chance to test ride the new bikes at the upcoming RAT raids."},

Sadly the July 4th weekend is well endeth, and the grind resumes on the morrow. Between pending work projects and packing for my impending move to a new residence, I expect the rest of July to evaporate forthwith in a puff of smoke.&lt;br />&lt;br />Tonight, however, I await an atypical pounding from a Midwestern thunderstorm, which is surging towards us in Doppler shades of deep green and yellow, as if we are Isengard and the Ents are falling upon us with great vengence and furious anger.&lt;br />&lt;br />I hope to pick up on a redrafting of a short story this evening...a story I've allowed to lie far too dormant after a round of feedback from friends/family. We'll see how it goes.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the meantime, some recent viewings/observations:&lt;br />&lt;br />1) &lt;strong>Farenheit 9/11&lt;/strong>: Saw the film in a relatively packed theater today -- a riveting experience of op-ed film. Having willingly and unwillingly absorbed a considerable amount of buzz about the film's assertions prior to seeing it, and being stolid in my voting choice this fall, I didn't expected to be swayed nor surprised...but I &lt;em>was &lt;/em>swayed (in a \"cementing what I already believe\" way) and surprised (by the emotional impact of the soldiers and their families who appear in the film -- the ones who carry the true in burden in any war where lives are lost). It was a powerful, thought-provoking film, and an essential counterbalance to the overwhelming bullshit of the rightwing nuts in TV/radio broadcasting. Huzzah.&lt;br />&lt;br />2) &lt;strong>Salem's Lot&lt;/strong>: Anybody catch the recent TNT cable miniseries? The novel (by Stephen King) is an annual read for me, as I am continually bewitched by its entropic tempo, its ominous sense of predetermined doom for its characters, and above all its merciless humor. Anyways, it's one of my favorite King books, and yet again it's been fucked up in adaptation to the small screen.&lt;br />&lt;br />The best you can say about the 1979 version, starring David Soul and directed by Tobe Hooper (auteur behind the original \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"), is that it at least had James Mason as Straker. and a certain schlocky character to it (although depicting Barlow as Max Schrek's grunting cousin was a tragedy).&lt;br />&lt;br />In this latest remake I most of all resented the excess liberties writer Peter Filardi took in his liberal rearrangement of the characters and their relationships (Susan being estranged from Ben Mears rang particularly false, as did the confrontation with Father Calahan in NY). It had a few bright moments (Rutger Hauer in the dump site, the kids on the school bus), but overall a wasted opportunity.&lt;br />&lt;br />To be clear, I'm not opposed to making necessary cuts and rearrangements to adapt a novel to the visual medium --- Peter Jackson's LOTR being one of many great examples of how to do this correctly. But too much tweaking screws up the momentum of the original narrative. Don't second guess the King. Anyways, I imagine this will be out on DVD sooner or later, but I wouldn't waste my time. Read the book instead.&lt;br />&lt;br />3) &lt;strong>Open Water&lt;/strong>: My pick for the sleeper flick to see this fall. Looks like a cross between Blair Witch Project and Jaws. Wow. Trailers are playing before \"Farenheit 9/11\". Nothing like a little shark action to liven the post-summer blockbuster season."},

Couple of days ago, I went out with Kristine to go see Harry Potter.  I have no idea why the hell I went to go see that.  I've never read the books nor I have seen the first two movies.  But it was all good because I was with my Kristine.  So the Monday-Thursday happened(Inside Joke your never gonna guess it).  But yeah I was just confused the whole movie.  But I had a great time with my baby.  Anyways so yeah also my Yiayia had a minor stroke.  It was a pretty scary thing.  Then on Saturday, I went to the V103 Car &amp; Bike Show.  It was so tight.  There were so many nice cars. OMG!  Sad thing is, I had to work at the show and not have too much time to look at the cars in the show.  I sat there and handed out flyers for hours.  There were soooo many people.  Good lord.  Anyways I also went to my uncles to go swimming have a little family get together for another birthday celebration for my sister.  So today was Fathers Day.  I spent a lot of time with my dad.  We went out to eat.  Then we went out to my grandfathers grave.  It was a very sad moment.  I miss him very much.  Then we went to my aunts house to go swim and eat dinner.  It was a very nice day.  So yeah next week is just gonna be great.  The only good thing will be my girlfriend's birthday on Friday.  Cant wait for that.  But lets see....Monday....Orthodontist.....Tuesday......Court for those bastards who put a gun to my head.........Wednesday.......I get to get my Wisdom teeth taken out!.....And the rest of the week......Soreness!"},

After all that, called Kristine and Taylor and we went to blue gold game.  Then alissa came up and starting talking to us.  I felt like i left her out there.  Then alissa invited us to go to her house. Without asking kristine i said yeah and so we went.  When we got there kristine wasnt very happy.  I asked her what was wrong but she didnt tell me.  Then she told me.  At first i was like what happened that one night, and then i remember.  I said i was sorry and i got sad.  But i didnt do anything.  So that was a mistake.  So then we went outside and everything seemed to be fine.  She left and i thought to myself i hope everything was alright.  Well this morning i was talking to her and stephanie says in the background that she wants to talk to me.  So i start talking to her but i have to go eat.  I come back home and kristine finally gives up and tells me whats wrong.   I feel like the biggest asshole in the world right now.  I feel so bad and sorry.  I wish i did something about it.  I wish i asked her if she wanted to go.  well, there really isnt anything i can do about it."},

Just met an awesome girl today while at work. This girl came up to the desk needing to download something onto her computer, but her computer's ethernet wasn't working, so she needed it on a disk. The computers at Brown do not have CD burners, and what she needed was bigger than what could be put on the obsolete floppy disks. The computer center at Brown was closed for the weekend, but luckily for this beautiful young lady, I had my trusty iBook with me, with a CD burner in tow, and was able to help her out. The conversation we had was just awesome. She just kept asking questions, probing-type questions that actually showed interest in me, of all people. I couldn't help but do the same. Ah, finally there is someone out there who seems, at least, to show some interest in me. Who knows what will become of this, as she has said she would stop by later on for visits, but for one day, this young lady has made me feel normal once more."},

Since this was a real shower and not a movie shower it is really too small for two people to share but the upside is that our naked bodies are almost always in contact. As is usually the case I spend too much time washing body parts that probably don't need cleaning but my wife humors me and her breasts are amazingly clean. They are large and real, they don't float lifelessly in midair like the large saline ones that grace most magazine covers today but instead sway with her every movement. Something that drives me insane is watching her breasts move in synchronicity with my thrusts as I make love to her. Now the foreplay is done and the soap is all rinsed away. She turns her back to me and puts her face into the shower and lets the water run through her hair. I slowly start kissing a trail down her spine until I come to her beautiful ass. Running my hands over her hips I run my tongue down the cleavage of her buttocks then gently nibble on her left cheek. She giggles and turns her body around then leans her back against the shower wall. The stream of water is directed at her chest and forms a river running between her breasts, down her stomach then between her legs where it turns into a waterfall which cascades to the tub. I crouch down and place my face in the falling water. As I lean forward and kiss the point where her left leg meets her body she raises her right leg and drapes it over my shoulder. My attention shifts and my tongue finds it's way to her. Her hair is trimmed short and her sex is perfection. I separate her and start to massage her with my tongue, avoiding her most sensitive of places my mouth explores her delicious folds until I can taste her essence mixing with the water from the shower. Even through the warm water I can feel her heat coming out towards my face. Finally, I concentrate my energies on her center, the nub of flesh that I worship and I can feel her hips start to rhythmically shift. My other hand comes up and I slowly enter her with the finger that bears the ring which sealed our promise to love eachother forever. Time begins to blur, I become too focused to think about things which would normally drive one to distraction, the water flowing across my face and filling my mouth, my knees and ankles which are probably numb, my back which is hunched over and supporting my wife against the wall of the shower. Finally, it happens, her hips thrusting violently against my face, I can feel her inside relax then grip at my ring finger, the leg over my shoulder tightens across the back of my neck and her other leg relaxes so I am now supporting most of her weight on my shoulders. After a short rest I stand and hold her tight against me and kiss the top of her head. My legs are weak and my feet are numb but I am in heaven."},

Reflect on the size and style of another person's shoes. And then, on Tuesday and Wednesday, relax into the idea of your smallness in the world -- not as any comment on your influence, but just to enjoy a healthy and productive instance of modesty.

Well, almost 2-3 months I guess. Have been pretty busy these days. Simply working, mugging, and also meeting up some of my old friends lately.&lt;br />&lt;br />Well let's see... where shall we start...&lt;br />&lt;br />Alright then, lets begin with New Year's Eve then. Hahah... Man, that's freaking way back. But since my last entry was during the Christmas season, I'll just write something brief on what I've been doing all the while.&lt;br />&lt;br />Yup, if I could recall, I've met Suix and Aw for dinner and clubbing for countdown. Three lonely guys. hahah.. But i would say we'd enjoyed ourselves. Head to KTV soon after the countdown. And we sang all night through. Well, guess who was one of the people we met at Zouk? The funnie man Ong Shuhan. That guy just came back from Australia, having his 3 months long break. Still looked pretty the same to me. He'll be going back there to complete his Masters, for a year more I guess.&lt;br />&lt;br />Hmm... then it was work, and work, and work again... Ah.. Then made Mr. Chu, Nicky, Robin, Brian, and some other 24SA fellow offices for a dinner. Still the same old Army guys, not much changes seen. Well, Robin's gonna leave Singapore for Australia too, to further his studies for 2 good years. Supposingly he was planning to stay locally to further his studies, by the man CO advised him to go abroad. And paid him back the full amount of downpayment that Robin had enrolled for. Crazy. But Mr.Chu and Nicky still was as busy as before. Working and studying part-time... Like me. =( &lt;br />&lt;br />Thereafter I met up with my secondary school friends. It was Poh's birthday, and they were celebrating in Dbl O. Haven't see them for a few months, since the big gathering back in June'04. That was pretty long... But I was so delighted to see them again. Poh, Alan, Kejia, Josephine, Ming, Wanting, Teo, Jack. But I arrived late and left early, as I was too tired to carry on. Is this a sign of aging? hah.&lt;br />&lt;br />Not long after, I reunited again with Poh, Ming, Merf, Teo, Alan, Wanting during the Chinese New Year season. Had a small dinner together, and some entertainment.&lt;br />&lt;br />Then there was Dheresse. Hahah.. so weird. I'd rather call her Wenz. (Pardon me if i write all your names in short forms here). This girl just came back from her holiday in Shanghai, China. Of course, she's working over there. Such a sweet girl, who called me in the early morning the day she arrived in Singapore (I think. haha). Humm.. I could still remember her face when we used to sit side-by-side during our Secondary 1 days. And we were sitting right at the front row! And we used to fool around there. Hahah.. And Ming was sitting right beside us on the right side. Ohh... Such beautiful memories we had... right? I wouldn't forget no matter what. I grew up with these people... Same class for 4 years. No doubt we'd bad memories along the way, but let us forget those bad ones, and leave those sweet ones in our hearts, ya?&lt;br />&lt;br />Alright back to the topic. Had dinner with Wenz, Ming, Teo. Supposingly with Pris and Ying, but both didn't turn out for dinner. Pris must have been dating her boy and forgotten the rest of the world huh? Haha.. kidding. Wenz still looked the same to me, still as lovely, although she kept saying that she had grown chubbier. 4 of us spoke about our lifes lately, what have we been doing lately, blah blah blah. But one important thing that I know is, the feeling is still there. The feeling when we were once in Secondary 1. And I felt extremely comfortable with them. 11 years of friendship. I'm so blessed to have them in part of my life.&lt;br />&lt;br />Then we had a rollin good time during our KTV session. We sang our hearts out, and enjoyed ourselves. Pris also joined us during the middle of it. I was overjoyed to see you guys and girls again.&lt;br />&lt;br />Then it was work, and work, and work again....&lt;br />&lt;br />Let me think again... a few days after that, I met up with my Primary school classmates at East Coast Chalet. Just a few hours short gathering. It was weilian's birthday then, and majority was his own friends. Only a handful of my Primary school friends turned up. Unlike that reunion back into 2003. Junjie, Zhiwei, Kathy, Yongsi, Tonghao, Simon, Huiqing, Yangzhi. We chatted all night long.&lt;br />&lt;br />Hmm... I remembered previously Ming kept pester me and asked me to go for his dance performance. Haha just joking. Told him I was working on that day. But who knows I rushed down to NTU to see him. But unfortunately, the performance ended once I arrived. All the audiences started to walk out of the auditorium. Although I wasn't successful to reach there on time, at least I arrived there to support you right Ming? &lt;br />&lt;br />There were also Wenz, Poh, Merf, Kejia, Alan around. Wenz left early, so the rest of us went for supper in Geylang after that. It was a food marathon, and we went to some famous stores located there. Luckily I didn't have any constipation after that night. Haha..&lt;br />&lt;br />Took leave the next day. Wenz was gonna return back to China. Woke up 5am in the morning. Was pretty exhuasted, but it was worthed it. Ming drove us (Alan, Teo, and me) to the airport, and met up with Wenz at Macdonalds. She was there with her parents. Took lotsa photos too. Haha.. I think I still don't have my clear mind, and my eyes looked so sleepy. But we chatted and laughed along the way. And ultimately, sent her into the departure hall. It was pretty sad to see her leave. Hope to see her soon this end of year when she comes back again, ya?&lt;br />&lt;br />And the day after, it was Alan's turn to leave. Damn, I hate that feeling... Went to the airport again, but this time only with Ming. Chilled with Ming, and later met Alan at the departure hall. His mum was there too. Alan's mum was pretty naggy at times, ever since we'd known her style since Secondary 1. Haha.. Back then it was worse. But her naggy was for Alan's good. We had a small lunch with Alan before he entered the gate. And still.. I don't like that feeling either..&lt;br />&lt;br />And now, after 1-2 weeks of the hectic activities I had, it's all back to normal. I've never regret, because I treated everything, everyone sincerely with my heart. I always tell myself (in Chinese) \u79bb\u522b \u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u518d\u76f8\u9047\u7684\u90a3\u4e00\u5929. And that day wouldn't be too long hopefully.&lt;br />&lt;br />I'm now working hard to fulfill my dream. I'm not gonna give up.&lt;br />&lt;br />-----------------------------------&lt;br />&lt;br />\u6211\u62fc\u4e86\u547d\u53bb\u8ffd&lt;br />\u8fd9\u4e00\u8def\u4e0a\u6709\u592a\u591a\u662f\u4e0e\u975e&lt;br />\u9519\u6216\u5bf9\u6211\u53c8\u80fd\u95ee\u8c01&lt;br />\u53ea\u6c42\u81ea\u5df1\u95ee\u5fc3\u540e\u65e0\u6127&lt;br />&lt;br />\u8dcc\u8dcc\u649e\u649e\u4e5f\u8bb8\u5f88\u72fc\u72c8&lt;br />\u591a\u5c11\u6b21\u6211\u7b11\u4e2d\u5e26\u7740\u6cea&lt;br />&lt;br />i won't give up&lt;br />take my hand&lt;br />\u56e0\u4e3a\u6709\u4f60\u7684\u7231\u5f53\u6211\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5&lt;br />\u68a6\u518d\u8fdc\u4e5f\u8981\u8ffd&lt;br />\u4e0d\u7ba1\u524d\u65b9\u6697\u85cf\u7740\u591a\u5c11\u5371\u9669\u4e00\u5b9a\u662f\u84dd\u5929&lt;br />&lt;br />-----------------------------------&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Now Spinnin :&lt;/span> [5566] \u6c38\u4e0d\u653e\u5f03&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Now Feelin :&lt;/span> Strong"},

All very well, and from my ideological point of view, an excellent move. However, as I will blog in the next few days and argue, this whole business of 'rewriting' history that is problematic. In fact the earlier textbooks (the original ones of Thapar, Bipan Chandra et al), through their omissions and silences actually gave the space for these 'alternate' histories to be written. This is not to say that all alternate histories are equally legitimate. There is after all, 'good' history and 'bad' history, to be judged on the basis on how accurately one can draw reasonable conclusions from the evidence placed before oneself. And no one is arguing that Joshi is a 'reasonable' person! But what is heartening about the NCERT's move is that it seeks not to introduce a standardised book for each Class, but a series of books or reading materials, that children can draw upon. This means that you will have one or two core textbooks, but for those further interested in the subject, the NCERT will provide some guidelines on what else they could read. Considering how boring and appalling the CBSE history exams are, this could only be a Good Thing. "},

I've spent the whole day trying to construct a reading list for my next thesis- a starting point, rather than a reading list would perhaps be a better term. Anyway, this exercise actually revealed a number of excellent sources on South Asian history, along with a number of other disturbing ones. I won't catalogue these now, but shall go on to say something about &lt;a href=\"http://www.telegraphindia.com/1040624/asp/frontpage/story_3410611.asp\">this news item &lt;/a>that has been bothering me for a while. On the face of it, Jemima and Imran's divorce is a matter fit for tabloids. However, read that article carefully and you will see all the racist bias of the British media being revealed. The stereotype of Islam, and by extension Pakistan being an oppressor is being bandied about. From what little I know of the country, Jemima would hardly have lived without an air conditioner (!) unless Imran is peculiarly miserly. High society in the subcontinent lives in lavish luxury that most people in the developing world will only be able to dream of. So my guess is that Jemima probably lived in a huge house, with servants at her disposal, every amenity she wanted, and simply got bored because she missed her London life. Fair enough, marriages have broken up for lesser reasons, but to villify an entire country, it's culture and by implication it's religion because this marriage didn't last, is utter rubbish. Somehow the whole notion that Jemima has been 'released' (as if it is not marriage that is a bondage, but marrying into a Muslim family that is), is quite repugnant. All thoughts on the matter would be very welcome. "},

Quite honestly, I'm on the proverbial fence with this one. I'm an 'at will' employee where I work, which means if they suddenly decide that I'm too fat, too white, too Republican, too much of an OU fan, too ugly, or just really really want to hire someone else to fill my position, they can tell me goodbye at any second. Luckily, I'm in an industry that few people want to work in, and with high turnover, so any happy, loyal employee such as myself has pretty good job security. (Yes, I really do love my job!)&lt;br />&lt;br />But if I started posting lies and half-truths, or even whole truths that paint my employer in a bad light, would they be justified in firing me? And just who are they firing? \"Nixon Casablanca\" (not my real name.) Yes, that' s my real picture, but couldn't I just as easily post as someone else? Or use a fake picture? Or post as a pet armadillo? &lt;br />&lt;br />I don't blog on company time, mainly because we have no internet access at work. If we did, I probably would, but only because I mostly work graveyard during which time we watch the kids sleep (and make sure they don't wake up and try to escape, stab eachother, etc.) We do have a LOT of paperwork to keep us busy, but we still manage to have several hours of idle time a night, which is usually filled with reading or light television watching.&lt;br />&lt;br />So, I've reached no conclusion, but then again, neither did the news story. Where do YOU stand?"},

Probably Shakespeare. Or maybe Sting. But at the moment, it's the sentence that best describes my tragic flaw: my inability to change. I don't think I'm alone in this. The more I get to know other people, the more I realize it's kind of everyone's flaw. &lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">Staying exactly the same for as long as possible, standing perfectly still... It feels safer somehow. And if you &lt;em>are&lt;/em> suffering, at least the pain is familiar. Because if you took that leap of faith, went outside the box, did something unexpected... Who knows what other pain might be out there waiting. Chances are it could be even worse. So you maintain the status quo. Choose the road already traveled. And it doesn't seem that bad, not as far as flaws go. You're not a drug addict. You're not killing anyone... Except maybe yourself a little. &lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">But, when we finally do change, I don't think it happens like an earthquake or an explosion, where all of a sudden we're like this different person. I think it's smaller than that. The kind of thing most people wouldn't even notice unless they looked really close. Which, thank God, they never do. But you notice it. Inside, to you that change feels like a world of difference. And you hope that it is. That this is the person you get to be forever... that you'll never have to change again. &lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">- - E.B.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>"},

This is Jon and I\u2019m here for another entry of YMU.&lt;br />&lt;br />I had a good weekend. My school was showing Ray and I saw it on Friday. Definitely Oscar worthy now that I\u2019ve seen it for myself. I\u2019ve been reading The Color Purple for my African American Lit class. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s told in prayers. I like it. I gotta see the movie after I\u2019m done.&lt;br />&lt;br />Now about the topic. Today I went to church and I was feeling a little bad about a few things. Lately I\u2019ve been feeling that I don\u2019t have time to things I want to do. It\u2019s always homework. I do my best not worry and trust God in everything, but it seems easier said than done most of the time. During worship I prayed to God to give me encouragement. Next thing I know one of the disciples had a verse that came to his heart and it spoke to me. 2 Corinthians 12:7-10. Paul was going through a rough time and the Lord said to him \u201cMy grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\u201d Paul realized that even though he was feeling week he was going to rejoice in Christ\u2019s strength and let him take over. That\u2019s something that I need to do. Having apprehension and all this stuff won\u2019t make your problems any better. You just have to bring them to Jesus and trust that everything is going to be brighter.&lt;br />&lt;br />I do have a bit of bad news. There was a shooting at a mall in my hometown, Kingston, NY. My mom told me about it today. It was one gunman and he injured a man in the leg.  Please pray for that man that everything turns out all right. He's in critical condition.&lt;br />&lt;br />I want to leave on a good note, so seeing as how Valentine\u2019s Day is tomorrow, I have a special poem I wrote for the occasion. It\u2019s called Real Love.&lt;br />&lt;br />My mind was boggled with woe and doubt&lt;br />My body double over by a massive amount&lt;br />I started to teeter and began to quit&lt;br />Defeat was something I had to admit&lt;br />But someone grabbed on and started to pull&lt;br />Soon I was up and saw you in full&lt;br />You comforted me giving assurance&lt;br />That you\u2019ll be there for the next occurrence&lt;br />&lt;br />I strolled down a path of darkness and forbid&lt;br />I tripped and fell and scurried and hid&lt;br />Your eyes filled with anger and mouth filled with scold&lt;br />But you wrapped me up close in your loving hold&lt;br />When you fixed my scrapes I didn\u2019t understand&lt;br />Tell me why you\u2019re here I said with command&lt;br />You looked in my eyes and in a sweet voice&lt;br />You said I\u2019m here because that is my choice&lt;br />I love you and it hurt to see you in pain&lt;br />Then I had a strange feeling that I yearned would remain&lt;br />&lt;br />A sense of joy exploded inside&lt;br />And my long journey had its demise&lt;br />I had traveled to seek a real, true love&lt;br />When all that was needed was to look above&lt;br />&lt;br />I\u2019ll be back with more soon. Until then this is Jon saying, \u201cGod\u2019s love is sufficient.\u201d"},

I've been in a car accident in the past and I can tell you that it freaks you out and makes you think.  The accident I was in wasn't major but it got me thinking that life is too short and that I should always be careful on the streets.  I just hope people would realize that speeding isn't worth risking your life.  Everybody should respect the speed limit and we should always be careful while driving.    "},

We have all seen the \"brave\" weatherman (or just the guy that drew the short straw) in a yellow rain suit standing out in the storm with his microphone in had trying to describe what it is like in 60+mph wind and rain.&lt;br />&lt;br />Before it hits, they cover the evacuation operations and show people boarding up windows preparing for the storm. They interview people who are leaving, asking them where they are going and if they are afraid their house will be damaged when they get back. &lt;br />&lt;br />But one thing I hear every time, one comment from a citizen that occours every time a hurrican hits. Even last year when four hit Florida in a row. I don't understand this comment. Maybe it is because I do not live there and live where things like this or other natural disasters do not occur.&lt;br />&lt;br />The comment that bothers me is when someone says that they had to drive to the next town to find a generator or that there was a rush at the hardware store to buy generators. What, they didn't buy one the last four times? Or did they buy one, but need a different one for this particular hurricane. What happened to the one they bought the last hurricane? I would think that if you lived where the treat of hurrican is always there, people would already have a generator or a plan of escape.&lt;br />&lt;br />I am not going to say these people are stupid, but come on. Every time, the news goes through the same old story, same lines, same consultants. And when they talk to people in the path of the hurricane, it is the same story every time. I had to search everywhere for a generator.&lt;br />&lt;br />Well, there it is. I am watching Fox News and there is the weather man standing in the rain trying to describe how hard the rain is falling and how hard the wind is. His rain suit is yellow. I don't know why it bothers me. Maybe because it seems just so stupid. It is a HURRICANE! Of course the wind is blowing. Of course it is raining. Of course the waves are pounding.&lt;br />&lt;br />Ok. That is enough of my ranging&lt;br />&lt;br />This is One Man's Opinion"},

I'm blogging less. Which is bad.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are reasons, though. Firstly, I've been up to my neck in chemistry, physics and mathematics homework. Thank the lord for me choosing media studies, which has managed to lighten the workload. I have to admit that I do actually enjoy doing those homeworks, because they give me a chance to &lt;a href=\"http://www.natnif.com/ms/\" target=\"_blank\">unload some of my creativity&lt;/a> (mostly when it isn't asked for, and usually in the form of nice, logical print design).&lt;br />&lt;br />Secondly, I've had a copy of the Sims 2 delivered to me by Amazon. Because I am such a procrastinator, I've just been playing on it all the time, and when I haven't been playing on it I have either been at school, doing the homework, eating, washing, or sleeping.&lt;br />&lt;br />Aaah. That's the life!&lt;br />&lt;br />I would definitely recommend the Sims 2 to anyone who wished to waste about a week of their free time. It's a very good game."},

The adverts aren't pop-ups or pup-unders (for that would break the webmaster code), but simple banner ads at the top and in the middle of the tests and results. They occur ever four questions.&lt;br />&lt;br />But here is the clever part: it only costs &amp;pound;0.04 to advertise a website on Google for the search terms \"gcse revision\" and \"gcse bitesize\" (the single-most searched thing when it comes to 'GCSE').&lt;br />&lt;br />I haven't started the adverts yet, but it sure is cheaper that I thought it would be.&lt;br />&lt;br />The second thing that I was thinking about is the whole notion of 'brand identity and experience' - what does busterTests stand for? What feelings to users get of busterTests? How can I make them like it?&lt;br />&lt;br />I am developing my ideas all the time, and I have to do so rather quickly for them to be applicable, but I am thinking towards the direction that busterTests should be a cheeky website. I want it to stand out from other boring sites (like bitesize) and make it a fun and engaging site that allows the users/students to progress at their own pace, whenever they want. I want them to think that busterTests is cool, and so that organic marketing can occur, and the site will be spread by word-of-mouth.&lt;br />&lt;br />More on this later."},

Basenji's are an African Hound dog. They are used for hunting small game. Our 4 year old 'senji's, Bob (25 lbs) and Lucy (23 lbs) decided they didn't like Jake, our 120 pound Lab-Rottie mix. They proceeded to open a can of whup ass on him. It didn't work. Jake cleaned their clocks. Lucy had a front leg broken and foot nearly chewed off. Bob had major muscle damage to his upper rear leg, his penis was bitten off and belly ripped open. Our Vet managed to repair them to near perfect condition. This was the first time Bob had attacked Jake. Lucy tried it two years ago and received injuries to her head, neck and chest. Basenji's are not known for having good sense. We did not buy these dogs. There's no dog in the world worth $600-$1000 each. All our dogs have been strays. Four years ago on Memorial Day weekend my wife opened the front door to get the newspaper and they were curled up on the porch bench. They ran in the house, jumped on the sofa and went to sleep. They had no collars, tags or microchip. We spent a month trying to find their owners without luck. Basenji's are really weird dogs. They are like a cat in a dog costume. They don't bark but make a noise like a human yawn sound. They will eat nearly anything that will fit down their throats. Bob's favorite treat is oranges. Lucy likes cucumbers with blue cheese dressing.     "},

Careful work since September has made this disc what it is and the band sound brilliant.  A 5-piece quintet bridging the sonic gaps between Phish-Pink Floyd and Radiohead.  Basic tracks were cut at the Tempermill Studios in Ferndale, Michigan and ensuing overdubs were done with the Third Monk mobile unit at various locations around Metro Detroit.&lt;br />&lt;br />Since the disc was mastered by Gavin Lurssen at the Mastering Lab, songs have already been aired on WSDP-FM, WHFR-FM, WRAX-FM and the band have performed live on the nationally syndicated Mitch Albom show as well as in the studios of WHFR-FM at Henry Ford Community College.  Further non-comercial radio airplay and a fall tour to college campuses in the midwest are in the cards for the band.  Let's wish them the best!&lt;br />&lt;br />Thanks to everyone who participated in the iTunes/Pepsi promotion.  With the deadline for use of Pepsi product caps with free downloads passing on May 23, 2005, we are grateful to anyone who had the opportunity to download Third Monk Records artists for free.  Songs from Third Monk Records artists remain available at all paid download sites from iTunes to Aol.com to Audiolunchbox.com.&lt;br />&lt;br />After the analog tape scare we had back in December, it is a great, great thing that Quantegy tape has been bought by 2 past employees.  The analog tape domain is precious and without it, the record making process would be seriously hindered.  Even in the face of the Digital Audio Workstation, the essence of analog tape can still be an essential ingredient to produce amazing  recordings of great songs.  Better still to think that Emtec (BASF) is back in the fray and ATR Services in Pennsylvania will be making their own analog tape.&lt;br />&lt;br />The music industry should continue to regain it's strength in the next 5 to 10 years while it recovers from the attack of the evil 3-headed hydra- namely Corporate Radio, illegal MP3 downloading and the advent of the Digital Audio Workstation.  With great trepidation, we should all be concerned and closely monitor the Elliot Spitzer Payola investigation in New York State and encourage legislation to be passed in Washington, D.C. to eliminate the ridiculous concept of songs as 'paid' advertisements.  As for the rest, everyman is empowered with their Digitial Audio Workstations and the industry finally has a grasp on how to make money selling mp3s.&lt;br />&lt;br />Let's hope for the best!"},

Borrowing members of the Lucinda Williams band, Adam has created a sound which hearkens to best of Crosby, Stills and Nash. Third Monk Records is very excited about this release!&lt;br />&lt;br />Currently, Third Monk is developing Detroit based act 'Step 13'. A solid pop/rock act in the style of Matchbox 20 or Coldplay, Third Monk is culitivating the necessary focus to a very talented band. New music should be available in the coming months.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the past 2 years, Third Monk has also served in a much more altruistic sense in a role that may help improve the music industry. Working as a watchdog of sorts with regard to the Corporate Radio/Payola situation that has become prevalent since the signing of the 'Telecommunications Act of 1996'. Coming up against the problem headlong with the Matthew Harrison disc \"Charmed\" at commercial alternative radio and finding out from various Program Directors that it would cost approximately $500-$1500 per new ad at a commercial radio station, Third Monk made the decision to work closely with the Los Angeles Times and ABC News to bring this issue to light. Obviously as an independent artist collective with modest roots, Third Monk could not afford the half million dollars it would have cost to make Matthew Harrison an overnight success nationally. Third Monk naively proceeded thinking the strength of the music would prevail and simply stated what we found out is this- music on public owned airwaves should not be 'paid advertising'- nor should it ever should be. More disturbing and at the detriment to the art, the broadcast conglomerates that have licensed these signals from the F.C.C. continue to abuse them on a daily basis. They play songs which have been paid for with absolutely no disclosure to the listenership about the practice.&lt;br />&lt;br />Third Monk filed complaints about this situation in 2001 with the F.C.C., Senators John McCain, Hillary Clinton, Joseph Lieberman, Harry Reid, Orrin Hatch, Babara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein and Representative Billy Tauzin. Third Monk also filed with the Attorney General in the state of California. Concurrent (and/or since) the exposure of this problem, Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold has drafted the 'Competition in Radio and Concert Industries Act' which was put before the House on January 28, 2003. The passage of this Bill is absolutely essential for the improved health of the music industry. People who are quick to blame the internet for the demise of the music industry fail to realize that it's the constriction at the main outlet source for new music that is at fault. With playlists taking on a 'national' scope instead of a 'local' viewpoint, indiosyncracies and local taste are sacrificed for money. Local programmers lose their ability to program and what songs get played is determined by what songs the radio station can bill for via their indie promoter.&lt;br />&lt;br />On a brighter note, Third Monk Records will begin to develop the sale of MP3 singles via this website. Focusing on material that Third Monk has cultivated, MP3 singles will be priced between $.99 and $1.49 and payments will be able to be made through Paypal. Anyone with interests in purchasing any of the existing Third Monk material via such means can make that request through the e-mail link on this site. &lt;br />&lt;br />A link to the hearings - &lt;a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/~commerce/\">Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation&lt;/A>&lt;br />&lt;br />Read &lt;a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20040202171457/http:/abcnews.go.com/sections/2020/2020/2020_payola_020524.html\" target=\"_self\">ABC's 20/20 article on Third Monk Records&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />Read &lt;a href=\"http://events.calendarlive.com/top/1,1419,L-LATimes-Search-X!ArticleDetail-43083,00.html\" target=\"_self\">L.A.

I truly believe Ted Kennedy's remarks comparing our current struggle against terrorist to Viet Nam as the catalyst that caused the deaths of over one hundred soldiers in April.  Comments or opinions like his should be hehind closed doors and not thrown out as political garbage.  Our enemies see weakness in those like Ted Kennedy and the candidate he supports John Kerry.  I would like to see the journalist look into the Awards &amp; Decorations writings at the time he served.  I would like an interview with the officer that wrote up the papers to submit for his awards.  I also would like to know the statistics of how many awards were given to the men and women on his boat during his four month tour in Nam.  Would those statistics show that John Kerry and his brothers received more than the average for that short of tour.  Till Later........."},

Great games and an awesome National Championship game.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Ducks performance was the only downer. We should have won. We played poorly and sadly I have to point to the coaching staff and their decisions.&lt;br />&lt;br />As for the rest of the top games, wow, Ohio State really impressed me in the Fiesta Bowl against Notre Dame, the Buckeyes are impressive. The Sugar Bowl, it looked like after the end of the first half that they would both score 60 points, amazing offenses. It was a fun first half of football. Of course they slowed down in the second half and it was a battle to the end.&lt;br />&lt;br />All of the BCS bowls were battles, the Orange Bowl, wow! Three overtimes! The missed field goals, the intensity was great, I was sure glad Kevin Kelly came through with his third chance to win the game. I am not sure he would have lived to old age if he would have missed another. Paterno and Bowden are the two winningest coaches in D-I football battling it out for over 4 hours (79 years old and 76 years old respectively). It was cool to watch.&lt;br />&lt;br />Then there came the Rose Bowl for the National Championship. I was saying before the game, this is the most significant football game of the century. Texas and USC, all the stories to be told, wow. Texas ranked number two all season, had an amazing year, routing most all of the teams they came up against. After the game commentators were asking if Vince Young (runner-up Heisman candidate) might be the best quarterback ever! He is amazing, he ran for 200 yards and He threw for 267 yards, in the Rose Bowl for the National Championship! This Young\u2019s second year in a row winning the Rose Bowl, his combined yardage and amazing \u2026. 839 yards in two Rose Bowls.&lt;br />&lt;br />\"That,\" USC coach Pete Carroll said, \"is an extraordinary football player.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />\"Vince is truly one of the great competitors to ever play college football,\" coach Mack Brown said Wednesday night. \"He has got a tremendous amount of confidence. He just exudes that confidence.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />And the USC Trojans \u2026 Matt Leinart comes back passing up tens of millions of dollars this year to go for his 3rd National Championship in a row. He was the Heisman winner in 2004, the top player in the whole nation. This year Reggie Bush, running back for USC, wins the Heisman and he deserved it he is like no other, he runs by defensive players like they are 7th grade girls. Two Heisman winners on one team playing for their 3rd National Championship, guarding a 34 game winning streak, they had not lost since 2003!&lt;br />&lt;br />Now the game, wow, they battle to the final seconds. There was no way to know the final outcome until the buzzer rang. Intense. Wow. That was fun."},

He entered the military to be able to study medicine and eventually use that for the Lord. About 6 months ago he felt convicted to leave the military and prepare himself for full-time Christian service. Saul shared that when he was in the military they would sleep with their weapon, learn how to take it apart and assemble it in the dark and carry it with them at all times. They knew it inside and out. He said for the next month he wants to do the same with his spiritual weapon (the Bible). He wants to spend as much time in the Word as he can and carry it with him wherever he goes, sleep with it, etc. \"Why should we know a physical weapon better than our spiritual weapon?\"&lt;br />Please pray for these youth who attended [the Youth Leaders Retreat]. They have the potential to change the youth of Mexico and God believes in them just like he does in you and I.&lt;br />&lt;br />TZOALLI'S BIRTHDAY&lt;br />One of those who attended the retreat is Tzoalli who celebrated her 30th birthday a couple of weeks ago. Tzoalli works for Johnson &amp; Co. here in Mexico and has a heart for evangelism. She has a sister who is a Christian but her brother and father are not. She has led several of her friends to the Lord and is working on others. This year she decided to give a birthday brunch for herself. But she didn't want it to be just a regular birthday party but an evangelistic one. So she asked some friends of hers who have a huge backyard if she could use it for the event. She invited half Christian friends and the other half non-Christian friends and family that she has been witnessing to. She asked all of her non-Christian friends ahead of time to be specifically praying for those who would be coming. She had a beautiful brunch catered with little place cards with scriptures on them. She had some friends sing some Christian music, she shared a testimony of what Christ had done in her life and she had Rodney share a short devotional thought.&lt;br />It was a meaningful time and those who were Christians had a great opportunity to get to know those who weren't and share in a casual environment. Please pray for Tzoalli and her continued witness to her friends and family that she will see the fruit of her efforts.&lt;br />&lt;br />Below are two pictures from the retreat plus a picture of Tzoalli sharing at her birthday brunch.&lt;br />&lt;br />Your Partners in Ministry,&lt;br />Rodney and Linda Peterson&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1950/409/1600/rodney%20p%20teaching.jpg\">&lt;img style=\"CURSOR: hand\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1950/409/320/rodney%20p%20teaching.jpg\" border=\"0\" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;a href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1950/409/1600/mexican%20group1.jpg\">&lt;img style=\"CURSOR: hand\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1950/409/320/mexican%20group1.jpg\" border=\"0\" />&lt;/a> &lt;a href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1950/409/1600/mexican%20testimony.jpg\">&lt;img style=\"CURSOR: hand\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1950/409/320/mexican%20testimony.jpg\" border=\"0\" />&lt;/a>"},

Very sad stories. I can\u2019t imagine losing family, friends, home, all possessions, neighborhoods, everything familiar. And \"Fats\" Domino is missing.&lt;br />&lt;br />My prayers are that the survivors might find God and a true relationship with Him through Jesus Christ is all this. God is good all the time! Even in tragedy He is working.&lt;br />&lt;br />However \u2026 who\u2019s idea was it to live 5-10\u2019 below sea level? What were they thinking \u2026 with a 20 mile long lake lurking over them just beyond a levee? Whose idea was that?&lt;br />&lt;br />So now we have 1000\u2019s dead and billions and billions of property damage. Who\u2019s going to pay for it? We are. Our government will give billions. Our insurance companies will pay out billions. Therefore, our taxes will go up and insurance rates will go up. So who pays for these people\u2019s lack of judgment, you and me.&lt;br />&lt;br />We, in the northwest, live in an area of the country that has virtually no natural disasters that cost the rest of the country, but we pay for them to live in hurricane country below sea level. Where is the fairness in that?&lt;br />&lt;br />Is it a good idea to rebuild these areas of New Orleans that are below sea level? I think not. Move north, man.&lt;br />&lt;br />I like what JACK CHAMBLESS, ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, VALENCIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE said to FOXNEWS in response to the question \u201cYou don\u2019t believe one taxpayer dollar should go toward rebuilding the city of New Orleans?\u201d:&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cWell, if we look at Article One, Section Eight of the United States Constitution \u2014 and I encourage all Americans to look at that before we start opening up our tax coffers to pay for all of this \u2014 we have every obligation to provide for New Orleans in terms of charity, private charity from one person to the other.&lt;br />&lt;br />But the founding fathers never intended, Article One, section Eight of the Constitution, never intended to provide one dollar of taxpayer dollars to pay for any disaster or anything that we might call charity. What we now have is the law of unintended consequences taking place, where FEMA has come into New Orleans, a place where, ecologically, it makes no sense to have levees keeping the Mississippi River from flooding into New Orleans, like it naturally should.&lt;br />&lt;br />Now with FEMA bailing out Louisiana, bailing out Florida and lowering the overall cost of living in these places, we have people with no incentive to leave. And the law of unintended consequences means that more people are dying with every one of these storms. They're becoming more and more expensive, more and more property loss, just because the federal government has violated the Constitution to provide for these funds.\u201d"},

SOMETHING FOR YOUR HEART&lt;br />&lt;br />Here's a brief reflection on the song \"Meant to Live\" by Switchfoot&lt;br />&lt;br />\"We were meant to live for so much more.&lt;br />&lt;br />Have we lost ourselves?&lt;br />&lt;br />Somewhere we live inside.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />I once heard a preacher say, \"We need to learn to live from the inside out.\" I think he was right.&lt;br />&lt;br /> Look at the words of Jesus:&lt;br />&lt;br />\"'Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.' By this he meant the Spirit, whom those believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified\" (John 7:38-39).&lt;br />Notice that life comes from the inside out, not from the outside in. So many of us have this mixed up. We try to get stuff, relationships, fame, or power to feed life into us, but none of those things can do that. The only source of life is found in God.&lt;br />&lt;br />\"Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me'\" (John 14:6).&lt;br />&lt;br />You can find life only in Jesus Christ, in a living relationship with him, through the Holy Spirit. You can draw life from him every day. His Spirit dwelling inside of you can bring life even in the most deadly of situations.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the song \"Meant to Live,\" Switchfoot sings about finding the life we were meant to live. You can only find that in the plan God has for your life. And that plan is right there, in your heart. As you fellowship with the Lord in his Word and in prayer, his Spirit will reveal that plan to your heart. Then you will know the life you were meant to live.&lt;br />(Suzy C.)&lt;br />&lt;br />Daily Reflections from Solid Sounds, copyright 2005 The Good News Broadcasting Association, Inc. (Solid Sounds).

What did-them-in, was their very poor free throw shooting and that overtime period.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Huskies have a problem with fouls and I think 3-4 of their players fouled out, however they have a deep enough bench to play a very good overtime to win the game.&lt;br />&lt;br />But if we would have simply made those 15 foot shots. Arrgh that is aggravating."},

Each one has their own take on what noodling is all about and what the secrets are. One of the noodlers has been mentioned prominently in the past, even having appeared on David Letterman, though I apparently missed that episode. They each come from very small towns in the backcountry and their passion happens to be catching giant catfish with their bare hands. One of the first shots of the film shows the self-proclaimed noodling champion up to his neck in dirty, placid river water, grimacing and then pulling to the surface a three-foot long, 35-pound catfish that has its mouth around his hand. You can also see the man\u2019s fingers coming out the gills, which is how he gets a grip on the fish. According to the director\u2019s commentary, this shot has elicited many a gasp from film festival crowds, and it is indeed a good way to start.&lt;br />&lt;br />From: &lt;a href=\"http://www.audiorevolution.com/dvd/revs/okie_noodlingp1.html\">www.audiorevolution.com/dvd/revs/okie_noodlingp1.html&lt;/a> 2.9.05&lt;br />&lt;br />Also: &lt;a href=\"http://www.okienoodling.com\">www.okienoodling.com&lt;/a>"},

The rates vary with age - @ 80 years old you would receive 8% annually or $800 @ 65 years old you would receive 6% or $600 annually. There are substantial tax benefits the year the gift is given and some savings each year there after. Your gift is another method to provide for educating ministers for the future. It is always best to check with your tax advisor or accountant to take full advantage of all tax benefits.&lt;br />&lt;br />(If for any reason you do not wish to receive this update or have another e-mail that we should use \u2013 notify by return e-mail.)"},

I went on BBC London last night to discuss the next day's papers witha very funny woman called Stella Duffy and the DJ, both of whom are ludicrously quick and hilariously funny. I was a bit stuffy alongside and my lack of encyclopaedic knowledge about showbiz didn't help. But whatever, the highlight of the evening was the cab ride home. I was driven by a Bulgarian guy who had made and lost fortunes in Bulgaria and told me a few explicit truths - summed up as 'don't waste your youth worrying'. I've often been under the impression that life is sending me clues, very much in the way omens are sugested by Paolo Coelho in the Alchemist. Except I don't believe in a higher power - at all - and so it makes it easy for me to ignore these impressions I get. But the truths are getting clearer and louder - I can't keep ignoring the evidence that I am wasting my life. I am pissed off - I am pissed off with my flatmate, who is also pissed off with life, I am pissed off with my job, where the confidence has drained out of me to an unrealised extent. I am pissed off with my inability to get out of bed to get to work on time, my inability to organise my life at all, my inability to get and hold down a relationship. I have all that anyone could want - I look reasonably nice, I'm quite intelligent, quite witty. I'm not the best at anything, but I have talents. Yet I find it so difficult to do or say anything at all. My only role among my friends is as a kind of eccentric. Maybe I have CJD. I'm still wearing my Dad's shirts. I never iron them. Myt trousers don't fit. Blah fucking blah - I bore even myself. Basically my life is barely tolerable. But I need to try to make money somehow. I like learning Arabic. I like salsa but it's hard to keep from thinking it's an exam rather than a pleasure. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. And I certainly don't know why I am putting all this up on a website next to a photo of me (well; noone is reading so it barely amtters). How postmodern, showing all the workings, except I don't feel like anything is working at all. and I feel the longer it doesn't the further away any prospect of realising any potential recedes. I am so used to failure now, personally and professionally, that I am slipping into a role of a bitter, disatisfied person whose creative synapses have withered through lack of use. I retain a certain arrogance, thinking wrongly that I could have been a prince, but under that increasingly brittle shell I am hollow. One day I will just collapse and the pieces will simply blow away."},

I tried to shut her up, but our parents saw that she was giving me an answer. The teacher walked in a few seconds later, oblivious that Melissa gave me and answer. However, my dad told her! The teacher became VERY angry, and grabbed our tests from us and told us that we failed the class for cheating. I started crying and begging her to reconsider, saying that we were not cheating.

I had crazy dreams last night. I dreamt I was in some quaint little town, and I was in a little cottage like house, and I had my hermit crabs. Then I was a little bird, and I was with some other little bird (I'm not sure who it was) and we were in another cottage style home/bookstore (think Beauty and the Beast) in the middle of a busy, but very sunny and cute, town. I was very tiny and we were flying around and trying to escape. There was normal sized people, and this woman with a snake. I was thinking that the snake was very poisonous and she should not touch it, but she was too ignorant to realize it. I flew out the window with my friend as I heard her screams as the snake attacked her throat, and she fell on the ground dead. We flew towards a huge river. The distance was very dark and foreboding. There was another city on the other side of the huge river, but this city was dark and in the middle of war, and a city of the future. We stopped on this long island in the middle of the two cities, which was just a huge forest. A huge storm was coming, and a tornado. The tornado was part man, though. He came running in our direction. We were still birds, and we flew to the southernmost tip of the island, and for some reason flew under the water, and grabbed onto some reeds. The tornado/man came, but we were underwater and holding tight to these water plants, so we did not get blown away. Next we found ourselves in the city of war. It was rather futuristic, and people were running through the streets screaming. These huge robots were lumbering about and blasting things with lasers. We flew to some tall building, and entered. I ceased being a bird here, and I was at work at the mall. However, instead of PP, it was some sort of Victoria's Secret. I was rearranging some wig rack (?) and all the managers were talking at the registers. Suddenly, the one manager called me over. \"You didn't say hello or goodbye to the customer that was just in here. I would like you to leave\" she told me. I apologized and said I didn't even see the customer. Then she was like \"You need to have a better look\" in this really bitchy voice. She said my panty hose were incorrect to company standards, and then asked to see my nails, and said they looked terrible, even though I said I was wearing their brand of polish. She kept saying \"You need to leave now\", so I was just like \"fine, whatever, I'll leave\". I didn't really care. She was such a bitch. I left, and somehow ended up in this warehouse/factory like building. It was very gray and full of metal and machinary. I found a group of people my age, who somehow knew who I was and were expecting me. Apparently there was a war and they were part of small resistance (why all my withdrawal dreams seem to involve wars and small resitances, I don't know). I joined, and we did lots of stuff with computers, and one day they opened up these huge gates. We were very, very tiny in comparisson. These gates were about as big as the entire warehouse wall. I looked out, and it was an endless blue sky and below, a huge bright blue ocean. We were about a mile up, but on the bottom of this huge building. Holding this massive building up were these huge stilts that reminded me of PVC tubing. We were very tiny, and we were fighting this war against these much larger people. It had a Waterworld feel to it. That's the end of my dream."},

My first dream was that I was some sort of priestess, and I was doing all these powerful magical spells. I was in the Casey's parking lot, and I was walking a circle, barefoot, around Dan, Kevin, Diane, Laura, and Mary Grace. I was dragging a sword in the ground around them, and it was making a golden circle around them. But the magic was so incredibly intense, I couldn't take it, it was running through me and I thought I would pass out, and I woke up so exhausted, like I had just run 50 miles. And there were all these weird symbols floating in front of me. Plus, I was dripping in a cold sweat. So, I went back to sleep. This time I had this dream that I was watching a movie, but I was in the movie and it was real at the same time. The Taliban or the Nazis or some general bad guy had taken over the world, it was WW3. I was in Chicago with my family and we were few of thousands of people trying to escape the city. But the bad guys were running around and shooting everyone and there was blood everywhere and we were trying to get across all these bridges. The bad guys got us and chained us and hundreds of others to this huge metal contraption and dropped it in the lake and we all drowned. But I kept seeing versions of this over and over again, my family and my boyfriend were murdered repeatedly in different ways along with thousands of others...it was part of a three part movie. The other parts took place in Italy where some people were putting up a resistance, and then somewhere in the Middle East where the pope and all these guys in turbans were running this mass genocide. It really was an awful, awful dream. I woke up again sweating. So, I went back to sleep after waking up from my everyone-dying dream. I had some more crazy dreams where I thought I was awake, but I couldn't move or wake up. "},

and Anna just learning to walk&lt;/i>?&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>And yet, here we are, writing again with Patrick about to complete his first semester at Harvey Mudd College (HMC) in Claremont, CA and Anna now looking for what college she might like to go to\u2026..&lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">how is that possible??&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div class=\"MsoNormal\">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class=\"MsoNormal\">&lt;span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Patrick is happily ensconced at HMC, which lives up to its tagline as\u2026. &lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">\u201cthe most amazing college you\u2019ve never heard of&lt;/i>.\u201d&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>The search/application/acceptance process was \u201cinteresting\u201d (&lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">&lt;u>read&lt;/u>:&lt;/i>&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>exhausting, nerve wracking, exhilarating) as all parents who have been through it can attest.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>Patrick \u201c&lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">knew&lt;/i>\u201d he wanted an engineering program &lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">at a large school&lt;/i>.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>He applied to many schools and was accepted at great schools including Duke where, in our minds in mid-April with the 1 May deadline approaching, he was going.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>&lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">However&lt;/i>.... there was &lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">this one school near LA&lt;/i>where he was accepted but had not visited.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>Fearing that Patrick would not be totally comfortable with the Duke decision without visiting all schools where he had been accepted, Shannon and Patrick decided to take a last minute visit to LA\u2026.. &lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">so, Patrick could \u201ccross HMC off the list&lt;/i>\u201d and move forward with Duke\u2026. &lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">or that is how they sold it to Karen.&lt;/i>&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>So, 4 days before the decision deadline they flew to the West Coast and visited Harvey Mudd.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>Patrick &lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">&lt;u>really&lt;/u>&lt;/i>liked it, which meant they now had to tell Karen, \u201c&lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Remember how we were crossing HMC off the list?&lt;/i> \u2026..&lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">well&lt;/i>, it has moved to the top of the list and Patrick is &lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">&lt;u>NOT&lt;/u>&lt;/i> going to college 92 miles away but rather 2,402 miles away.\u201d Karen is still left wondering if the deciding factor wasn\u2019t when the tour guide told them that the Honor Code at HMC was simple and straight forward \u2013 students must always act as responsible individuals and that the only \u201crules\u201d on campus were those instituted only after a &lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">demonstrated&lt;/i>need for them.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>Some examples:&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>\u201c&lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">All pranks must be reversible within 24 hours&lt;/i>.\u201d&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>\u201c&lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">No flames can be higher than the buildings&lt;/i>.\u201d&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>\u201c&lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">No projectile can leave campus&lt;/i>.\u201d&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>Patrick was &lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">sold (hardly a surprise to those of you who know him well!)&lt;/i>, committed to HMC on 1 May, and has not looked back.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div class=\"MsoNormal\">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class=\"MsoNormal\">&lt;span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Anna, a junior, is getting mail/emails from schools and, so, we get to start over again.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>Her interests are very different than Patrick\u2019s, although she excels at math and science, she will undoubtedly follow her interests and look for strong humanities and arts programs.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>We all think a smaller school is best for her\u2026. &lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">which probably means she will end up at a big school&lt;/i>! &lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>Anna spent 3 weeks at an art program in Vermont this summer and &lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">absolutely loved&lt;/i> the experience, including the chance to spend a little time with her cousins who live nearby.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>Her cousins certainly hope she goes to college in New England.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>In addition to a very challenging academic schedule, Anna is involved in varsity tennis, winter cheer leading, orchestra and honors art.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div class=\"MsoNormal\">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class=\"MsoNormal\">&lt;span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">A key highlight of our year was an extended summer trip to Vietnam and Cambodia.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>If you are asking \u201c&lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">why those two destinations&lt;/i>?\u201d you are asking the same question Shannon asked.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>In mid-2012, Patrick announced to Shannon, \u201cWe are going to Cambodia in 2013!\u201d&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>To which Shannon replied \u201cNo, we\u2019re not!\u201d&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>\u201cYes we are.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>&lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">Mom said so&lt;/i>!\u201d&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>Apparently (&lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">unbeknownst to Shannon&lt;/i>), Karen told both children years ago that the year they graduated from high school they could pick the destination for the family vacation.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>Patrick chose Cambodia because of a long-standing fascination with Angkor Wat (one of the wonders of the world).&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>We spent three great days in Siem Reap near Angkor Wat and the other amazing Khmer ruins and added Vietnam to the itinerary because of the fabulous history and culture.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>It was truly a great vacation with a perfect mix of culture, food, scenery, history and relaxation.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>Anna is mum about where she wants to go for \u201cher trip\u201d in 2015, though she is getting lots of suggestions from the rest of the family.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>We vetoed the idea of her going on a separate vacation which -- as a 17 year old girl -- sounded just perfect to her.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div class=\"MsoNormal\">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class=\"MsoNormal\">&lt;span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Shannon entered his 60&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup>decade, turning 50 in August.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>In an attempt to prove he is still young and active he has scheduled a scuba diving trip with Anna and a ski trip with Patrick.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>Shannon also &lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">added another&lt;/i>milestone\u2026 his 2013 international work travel was even heavier than usual.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>So, this year he flew his &lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">millionth mile on Delta (!!) &lt;/i>&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>\u2013 We are not sure if that is a good or bad thing.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>But we are eager to learn if the alleged \u201cperk\u201d of a Porsche ride across the tarmac in Atlanta if you are late for your flight is real or urban lore.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>We will keep you posted.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>Karen feels that she spends more time with our beloved dog Tesla than any of the others but is always thrilled when we end up with a \u201cfull nest\u201d \u2013an increasingly rare experience these days.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div class=\"MsoNormal\">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class=\"MsoNormal\">&lt;span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Patrick can be very thoughtful with his gifts: &lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>for Shannon\u2019s 50&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> he shared a list of 50 memories of Dad and for Mother\u2019s day, he made Karen some jewelry, feeling obligated to announce, as she opened the gifts, \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2026. &lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">all the materials used are non-toxic&lt;/i>!\u201d&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>Anyone who knows Patrick and his elements collection knows that that statement was relevant&lt;i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">\u2026.and necessary! &lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div class=\"MsoNormal\">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class=\"MsoNormal\">&lt;span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">We have now been lived in Winston-Salem for more than 20 years, the longest we have ever lived anywhere.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>If you had told us in the early 90s that we would still be here in 2013, we would have thought you were crazy.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>However, having raised two kids and held multiple different jobs in different industries, we feel incredibly fortunate to be where we are with the friends and the family we have.&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>We wish all of those would come and visit!&lt;span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>Happy Holidays and best wishes for 2014!&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;/div>"},

Does it move? Is it static? Is today tomorrow\u00b4s yesterday? What is humanity\u00b4s role or purpose in this static continuum?&lt;br />&lt;br />Civilizations appear and disappear. We appear and disappear and between one event and the other, time gives us its precious gift, the gift of existence. Life, death , growth, decay, happiness, joy, decease, sadness, healing, wealth, our own survival depends on time. Everything depends on it. Everything changes between one event and another. With the passage of time everything changes, even static things age in constant flux and transformation. We are not the same creatures we started out being nor are we the same persons we will become. We transform. One being completely different in body and mind. Evolved from simple to complex through growth. We are an expression of time, change and evolution.&lt;br />&lt;br />Is evolution, growth, transformation or time creations of a higher power or a mindless universe ?&lt;br />These writings do not attempt to deal with those questions, they only attempt to establish certain links and correlations between them: Evolution takes time. Time expresses itself through evolution. Evolution is a transformation.&lt;br />Time is all.&lt;br />&lt;br />Evolution and transformation come about as an expression. The Human expression exists through inter-dependent phenomena. An expression with an ultimate goal: Full development. In social evolution the goal is to express a human being fully self-contained, physically and intellectually with no further need of corrective after thought devices like laws or archaic arithmetical monetary systems to deal with each other. What for? if each human is complete and total, developed through: Knowledge. Extensive education, as much as each person desires. A social minimum> 20 years? 25? 30?&lt;br />&lt;br />A society that exists in time like anything else; evolves. It makes its developmental pattern from simple to complex automatically through growth and change . The goal of any society is to make things better through some means or other. If its members are not allowed to fully develop, intellectual corollary systems will be developeded to fill in the vacuum. Social institutions, correctional specially, will obligatorally be developed through the evolutive mechanism. Laws will have to be created and enforced depending on what was not fully acomplished in the preceding evolutive step. If in the human relations area; laws, courts, police forces will fill in the vacuum. If in the spiritual area, religions will fill in the vacuum.&lt;br />&lt;br />To survive on this planet, humanity has experienced the hard way to interact and exchange within itself and with every specie on it, one way or another. The earliest was the barter system; with the animal kingdom: I\u00b4ll keep you, I\u00b4ll feed you, I\u00b4ll take care of you, in exchange -- Ill take your hide or your meat. With the plant and mineral kingdom it has been basically the same exchange plus, we have learned not to pollute or we will not be able to breath.&lt;br />&lt;br />In bartering, if there are human beings not fully develloped, who do not understand the laws of equilibrium, ( equal exchange ), in other words think that they can or should get something for nothing, then social evolution will take over and fill the void: it will develop systems that will force them if not to undertand at least to make them live in relative harmony with the imposed laws, regulations of the corrollary corrective systems.  &lt;br />Among the developed systems: the monetary system.&lt;br />&lt;br />If knowledge is not diseminated equally among the members of a society and some remain somewhat ignorant or completly ignorant of their roles in their group or society, geographical area, planet, space in time, history or universe and if barriers like language or distance seem insourmoutable like in societies early development, the monetary corrective system will become an evolutionary necessity.&lt;br />&lt;br />Money: An artificial mathematical exact systems of transaction, to help with the vacuum that ignorance produces. If the individual does not know how to deal with the rest of the group, rules will be imposed on him.&lt;br />The monetary system depends on its own inherent rules and regulations that must be adhered to for it to work, for as in any mindles system it works on his own terms.&lt;br />If a corrective system like the monetary one is used, societys highest potential has not been reached.&lt;br />&lt;br />Money performs at its best in concret terms, with tangibles. It does not understand or deal with feelings, morals or ethics. Usualy, morals suffer like in the following example: we are always chasing after the better deal. The more for less deal. In shopping, we want more for less, to the point that we are willing to turn a blind eye if a product has to be manufactured in a less developed country where labor is cheaper even if the working conditions are sub-human.&lt;br />Another aspect of money or mathematical transaction that is almost imposible to understand is the disconnect.&lt;br />&lt;br />The disconnect relates to when something has or appears to have no connection with another, example: Addiction to drugs. Nine out of ten drug addicts at the time they purchase them do not relate to the chain of events unleashed at that moment, specially when many of the events will happen to other peoples in other lands far away from them in time and space.&lt;br />&lt;br />The \"more for less\" aspect is especially difficult to assimilate specially when dealing with intangibles like the ones mentioned above, it engenders a host of problems and is based soley on mechanical transaction, a transaction that is sometimes not easily understood by a not sufficiently developed or evolutionized or knowledgeable person. In that sense, if we continue to have under educated people we will have the same problem. The numbers game can be manipulated in other ways by those who know.&lt;br />&lt;br />More work from employee: for less wages.&lt;br />&lt;br />More price: for less quality.&lt;br />&lt;br />And on , and on , endlessly.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />The more for less theory is applied throughout the system, inflation is a vital part of it and we are constantly trying to catch up with it. Quality of life is forced to be cheepened in every respect. It is the only way the system can work.&lt;br />New language emerges such as: Corporate Economic Restructuring. Whereby the company must produce more with less workers and cheaper materials and thousands of jobs and lives are erased and destroyed.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />UTOPIA (Does it exist?)&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />There is no such thing as social human utopia.&lt;br />&lt;strong>It is the ultimate goal of evolution ( any evolution ) to attain perfection&lt;/strong>. Eventually language will include words like cheat, steal, rob, even the word truth only in a historical context \"when man was underdeveloped and there existed social corollary suport systems to fill in .&lt;br />&lt;br />Basic law of time: Relativity.&lt;br />To the cave man democracy is utopian. To us they are undeveloped.&lt;br />Obviously the best society is one based on truth and trust alone with no need for correcting systems like money because clearly; if you are fully and totally developed, you will always do what is ethically and truthfully correct and to the end : Truth is the great equalizer.. A trust that comes about becaues you know that whatever anybody says or does (exept for mistakes or lack of knowledge which will be aknowleged and quickly corrected) must be true and ethical because there are no hidden purposes, pressures or agendas.&lt;br />Only mankind strives to understand concepts of time and evolution in its relentless persuit for perfection. The only question is : How much time will it take us to fully accept that fact and how long are we to make the intervening steps of understanding and acceptance:&lt;br />days,&lt;br />years,&lt;br />millenia?&lt;br />It is hard for us to imagine or accept from our point of view, a more different world but it is only a question of relativity.&lt;br />If and only if EVERY AND EACH human being on this planet is fully develloped socially through knowledge and education so that we have no need for corrolary systems like:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />* Money&lt;br />Religion&lt;br />Law&lt;br />Law Enforcement&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />*These 4 concepts will only exist in history books.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />The only motivation needed for a fully developed person to act is the eagerness to participate in an environment that is truthful, fair, exiting and willing to share all its physical, spiritual and intellectual riches. Social and cultural evolutions are intrinsically linked to their environment. All three are depndent on each other and develop accordingly, to a certain extent they react automatically.&lt;br />If corrective systems are allowed to exist for too long, they become the norm and they grow and develop themselves and with beings as sophisticated, sensitive and social as human beings, they bring around the problem of invisible social barriers and intellectual barriers like political division and money division.&lt;br />&lt;br />If a well developed colony of ants or bees who had reached the peak of their development were to be put in the same predicament, they would soon find themselves in our same situation> at odds with each other.&lt;br />As long as we hold on to our knowledge vacuums where some members of our societies remain undeveloped, socialy we will not be free.&lt;br />We will remain slaves to our inability of seeing beyond the next curve.&lt;br />&lt;br />The only way out is to lift up from ignorance every single child alive, everywhere in this planet.&lt;br />&lt;br />The answer is : Knowledge through education. So we do not have to deal with the corrective systems.&lt;br />&lt;br />No money.&lt;br />No religion. ( Spirituality, Yes)&lt;br />No Laws.&lt;br />&lt;br />No need for any of them. If every single one of us is illuminated inside by knowledge."},

And of course, Taking Back Sunday did wonderfully. I was extrememly stoked even though I wasn't close to the stage. I even got autographs :). Yeah and an even bigger plus...

I like to call it \u201cpeople power\u201d. What used to be called consumers have become the Internet producers. It stared with message boards, went on to P2P, online gaming, photo sharing and finally nuevo journalism or blogging. It gives social networking a whole new direction. The act of sharing be it their day, thoughts, opinions or photos, these new producers are dictating where the Internet begins and ends. The new producers of content will inevitably take over from mainstream media.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the process of sharing is where a gateway to the future of the internet was revealed. When each person began to reveal their truths and realized that there are more similarities between people than there are differences. This awareness has created a power stream and thus a shift in the collective consciousness. A new form of thought leadership is bound to emerge from this. But unlike the lone figure standing on a pedestal speaking for his people, this it will be the collective voice of all humanity. And the microphone thru which they speak will be the INTERNET.&lt;br />&lt;br />That can never be a bad thing. Because for once decisions will be made collectively. In the process of doing so, the connection the internet provides will show that ultimately we want the same things.These communities are already talking and the power brokers are listening. With this change, it begs the question, what will the Internet become?&lt;br />&lt;br />The internet will become the channel and the reference point for every new invention. It will become an ecosystem that states what we want, what we need, and how we need it. The way businesses deal with this will be the challenge. Because previously, an invention was made and marketed and only after getting feedback was it improved upon (Microsoft is a good example) and then it went on to be called innovation. This time around, the winning invention is the one that was commissioned by the producers of the internet. Not literary commissioned, but as natural progression that comes when millions of people around the globe share their views, thoughts and opinions about what stays and what goes.&lt;br />&lt;br />It will not only shape the economics and politics of the world but lift the collective consciousness of humanity to level never before experienced. With blogging and other forms social networking, there is now a source where almost every human mind is plugged into. This source is an invaluable tool that will make a difference whether we like it or not."},

My family are from that seafaring city and my Dad saw the beatles when they played the cavern club (He left after a few minutes because they were \"rubbish\").  I have secrets, like all laid back worriers, and I hope to share some of them with u.  If anyone actually reads any of this then I will be very interested to hear how interesting you find it .  I have concerns about nobody liking, or indeed reading any of this tripe (worry factor7) and I will now sign off, having completed this first blog. There, it is done. Publish and be damned!"},

L\u00e1 existe uma cena alternativa muito criativa com a m\u00fasica instrumental. Lembro uma noite depois de um show q toquei com o Lulu Santos no Palace (agora \u00e9 Garden Hall, ou Credicard Hall ou alguma porra de Hall!!), sa\u00ed com alguns amigos pra tomar um choppe e fomos pra algum barzinho in\u00f3cuo. In\u00f3cuo?? P\u00f3, l\u00e1 tava rolando o maior som com uma forma\u00e7\u00e3o totalmente original. Um Sax tenor, uma trompa, um trombone, baixo ac\u00fastico, piano e vibrafone! Nossa, estava soando lindo!! Quando \u00e9 q se v\u00ea algo assim no Rio? Aqui vc vai negociar com alguma casa noturna e nego j\u00e1 vem falando sobre cheque cau\u00e7\u00e3o. What?? Negociei ent\u00e3o com uma casa relativamente nova q fica na Lagoa. Partitura \u00e9 o nome. L\u00e1 espero criar uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o de parceria com a casa. Pedi logo q me dessem um m\u00eas, deixando o meu 4teto tocar toda quarta-feira pra gente poder criar um bochicho. M\u00fasica instrumental onde se ouve Beatles, James Brown, Led Zeppelin, Egberto Gismonti, John Scofield, The Meters e composi\u00e7\u00f5es pr\u00f3prias. Acho q vai dar p\u00e9.

Sempre curti m\u00fasica instrumental com um conceito sonoro. Um som ao mesmo tempo ensaiado por\u00e9m livre para a cria\u00e7\u00e3o espont\u00e2nea. Weather Report, o famoso quinteto de Miles, Medeski/Martin e Wood, a parede sonora de John Coltrane (ahhh Elvin Jones, que maravilha!!!!!!).

Por outro lado, os amantes da pancadaria devem ficar achando, \u201cih, tinha q ser um m\u00fasico pra fazer uma luta n\u00e3o competitiva\u201d. Ontem mesmo fazendo uma busca na Web sobre o Aikido no Brasil me deparei com um \u201cpost\u201d q algu\u00e9m tinha colocado num site alegando q \u201co Aikido \u00e9 uma luta boba,  coreografada, sem sentido e imprest\u00e1vel para a defesa pessoal\u201d.  O Aikido \u00e9 uma arte marcial. Acreditem. N\u00e3o \u00e9 uma pr\u00e1tica bonitinha pra todo mundo se harmonizar e comer arroz integral olhando o p\u00f4r do sol! Se vc estiver procurando por t\u00e9cnicas de defesa pessoal pra machucar algu\u00e9m e controlar UMA PESSOA, sugiro a pr\u00e1tica do Jiu-Jitsu ou Vale Tudo ou at\u00e9 mesmo o Box tradicional. Agora vamos parar um segundo pra pensar. N\u00e3o \u00e9 muito melhor evitar uma briga do q lev\u00e1-la \u00e0s \u00faltimas consequencias? N\u00e3o \u00e9 muito mais importante vencer sem haver derramamento de sangue. N\u00e3o seria melhor treinar uma arte onde vc desenvolve o sexto sentido, lutando contra TRES OU MAIS PESSOAS?? O Aikido tem tudo \u00e0 ver com a minha m\u00fasica: \u00e9 para unir e n\u00e3o segregar, \u00e9 para sentir e n\u00e3o intelectualizar e \u00e9 para trabalhar a agressividade sem machucar. Alguns anos atr\u00e1s joguei fora alguns pr\u00eamios q tinha recebido ao longo da minha carreira como m\u00fasico, arranjador e produtor. Uns trof\u00e9us rid\u00edculos q me irritavam toda vez q os via na estante. Melhor instrumentista: Christiaan Oyens. Melhor fascista: George W. Bush. Que saco!! Foi tudo pro lixo! N\u00e3o me agrada a id\u00e9ia de estimular a competi\u00e7\u00e3o numa disciplina espiritual como a m\u00fasica. \u00c0s pessoas q inventam estes pr\u00eamios n\u00e3o est\u00e3o entendendo!

Almonds, honey, orange blossoms and earth. Luscious, with oranges, almonds and stewed peaches, but not at all heavy. Very smooth, with a lemon-meringue finish.&lt;br />&lt;br />Golden and green-tinged. A nose of nectar -- pears, apples, orange blossoms and peaches -- and roasted mixed nuts: walnuts, almonds, pistachios. Mouth-coating, with ripe apricots, great acids and egg-white fluffiness on the long, clean finish. Surprisingly light on its feet.&lt;br />[nowides] OUR FAVORITES&lt;br /> &lt;br />[Tastings]&lt;br />In a tasting of Sauternes from the excellent 2001 vintage, these were our favorites.&lt;br />&lt;br />Sigh. Wait, where were we? Oh, here: Every year around this time, we're asked something like this: \"I'd like to get a bottle of wine for a friend who's really into wine, but he already buys good stuff by the case, so what could I possibly give him?\" This year, here's the answer: a bottle of Sauternes from the well-regarded 2001 vintage, which is just arriving in stores now. This is a gift that will show research and good taste, and it's truly one that will keep on giving for many years, but we'll get back to that.&lt;br />&lt;br />There is no sweeter gift than Sauternes, and we mean that literally. Sauternes, from the Bordeaux region of France, is the world's greatest sweet wine. (The name, sometimes spelled Sauterne, was appropriated by some American wineries for sweet, simple wines, but they're unrelated.) It is made from grapes -- Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc, sometimes along with Muscadelle -- that have been allowed to remain on the vine in misty conditions until they are attacked by botrytis cinerea, the famous \"noble rot\" that shrivels the grapes and concentrates the juice into a rare and remarkable nectar.&lt;br />&lt;br />Leaving the grapes on the vine until they are attacked by mold is obviously risky -- in fact, some Sauternes producers don't make any wine at all in troubled years. And harvesting those grapes and making this wine is labor-intensive and expensive. So these wines should cost a fortune, but, on the whole, they don't, we're happy to say, because sweet wines generally aren't in vogue.&lt;br />&lt;br />Genuinely Exciting&lt;br />&lt;br />But here's the thing: True wine lovers know the real value of Sauternes, and that's why this is such a great present. While many of the world's sweet wines are flabby sugar bombs, Sauternes is not. Think about the ripest, freshest, juiciest piece of fruit you've ever tasted. Sure, it was sweet, but the primary taste was fruit, not sugar, and the sweet tastes were probably balanced with some tartness and good acidity. That's the wonder of Sauternes. Its abundant acids, great earthiness and ripe fruit taste like juicy, fresh-from-the-tree-or-vine fruit, not like sugar. In a good Sauternes, the smell itself is both sweet and nicely acidic, making it mouth-watering even before it's sipped. At their best, these wines are genuinely exciting.&lt;br />&lt;br />Did we say earthiness? Heaven knows this is hard to explain, but in the very best Sauternes -- and especially the famous Chateau d'Yquem, the greatest Sauternes -- we sometimes feel as though we're drinking nectar that's been filtered through rich earth. It's that elemental -- and unique.&lt;br />&lt;br />The 2001 Yquem, which has been widely praised, hasn't yet been released. (It might be available for Christmas, at $400 a bottle or more.) But many other Sauternes from 2001 have hit the shelves, so we figured we'd pick up enough for a large tasting to see how they are. We set no price limit, so we ultimately spent up to $129.95, though most of the wines were less than $50. We bought wines labeled Sauternes and labeled Barsac, which is one of the villages of Sauternes and is allowed to use its own name. The wines of Barsac are generally considered somewhat lighter and perhaps a little more elegant than many wines labeled simply Sauternes.&lt;br />&lt;br />We are sometimes told that fine French wines aren't available in California -- can you imagine? -- so we made a point of buying most of the wines for this tasting there. We tasted the wines blind in flights over several nights, and we're here to tell you: These are delicious, memorable wines. Wine after wine offered a luscious nose of orange blossoms and brioche, a rich taste of fruit, earth and nuts, and a lingering finish of sweet, ripe fruit that sometimes left us at a loss for words. Or perhaps we just didn't want to speak and risk losing the state of mind that the taste had induced.&lt;br />&lt;br />Golden Tastes&lt;br />&lt;br />During the tasting, John asked Dottie how we could describe Sauternes that might convince a sweet-resistant wine drinker to give it a try. Dottie thought for a moment and replied: \"It's like the sun. There's a gleaming richness to it. It tastes golden. It's smooth, with a sweetness that bursts in your mouth and then surprises you with such a clean, bracing finish.\" As we said, sigh.&lt;br />&lt;br />We ultimately couldn't pick just one wine for our best of tasting. Two wines, both of which we rated Delicious, qualified for the top spot: Chateau de Malle, the wine we described above as \"the total package,\" and the other one above, Chateau Nairac from Barsac, which had the fluffy finish, something you will just have to experience to fully understand.&lt;br />&lt;br />But this is important: These wines won't be at their best for many years. In fact, our advice for new parents who want to lay down wine for their child is always Sauternes because it ages so well for so long. Not only that -- and, for your present, this is particularly important -- but the wine gets more and more beautiful to look at as it ages. Even in youth, Sauternes is beautiful in its clear bottle -- golden, sometimes with green highlights. With each year, the wine gets even more stunning, with its gold becoming dark and richer-looking. Long before the bottle is open, it has already given such joy. So this holiday season, give your friend a bottle of 2001 Sauternes, but be sure to write something like this on the label: \"Happy holidays 2005. May your life, like this wine, get better every year.\""},

The books that are being sold have been donated by our congregations members.  Last night we were browsing through some of the books for sale and I started to wonder why folks would give away some of the books that were there, i.e. Little Golden Books, Curious George, recent Oprah Book Club books.  We are avid readers in our family, each one of us normally having at least one if not two books going at the same time.  To say that we get restless if we don't have something to read is an understatment.  But, our problem is, and it is evident by the scads of boxes that we have, we just can't give books away.  My husband and I still have several of our college textbooks left- although they are probably out of date, but the human body doesn't change that much so an Anatomy and Physiology book is still in vogue. To us, they are a precious comodity.  Who knows when you might want to read it again, or share it with a friend, or start a book club!  So, as you can see I have a difficult time understanding why someone would want to get rid of their books! But, then again I started thinking--- if it weren't for those folks that want to get rid of their books, I might not have anything to buy on Saturday for a cheap price.  So thanks to all of you that donated to our book sale for filling my already overfilled shelves here at home!!!  You guys rock!"},

Thanks to an organization called \"Life Challenges\" it allows these folks to find freedom from their wheelchairs and the restrictions they face because of their disability!  How awesome it was to watch them on T.V. experiencing sky diving from 13,000 feet and having the time of their life.  It isn't about being disabled, but being able and all about living life to the fullest!  Personally I think anyone that sky dives is pretty brave, and so my hat is off to these very special brave sky divers and cudo's to \"Life Challenges\" for providing such an awesome opportunity to them.

It contains hyper-kinetic rap, hip-hop, R and B and is most notable for the hit \"I like the Way You Move.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;em>The Love Below, &lt;/em>Andre 3000's collection contains 20 tracks that for the most part are impossible to label. A mixture of rap, R and B, rock, jazz and other contemporary styles, &lt;em>The Love &lt;/em>Below is a gutsy release from the duo that has, for the most part, appealed to the rap crowd. \"Hey Ya,\" changed all of that. So did the follow up single, \"Roses.\" OutKast became a household name and reached heights few artists will ever see.&lt;br />&lt;br />Although &lt;em>The Love Below&lt;/em> contains many lasting tracks, the most memorable is \"Take Off Your Cool,\" a simple two and a half minute long duet between Andre and Norah Jones. Driven by a sole acoustic guitar (although bits of keyboard pop up in the background), the song sets the mood quickly with a series of open chords lazily strummed by Andre while the duo playfully scat. Jones' vocal after the intro is sultry and inviting. It's also repetitive. The song has few lyrics yet never seems lacking.&lt;br />&lt;br />The song's beauty is its simplicity. And I really can't say it any simpler than that. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;iframe style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ac&amp;ref=tf_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=alwthelasinli-20&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=B001416PMG&amp;asins=B001416PMG&amp;linkId=IXVF5QNM6VOOM7OX&amp;show_border=true&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true\">&lt;/iframe>"},

So I was confronted. I told them that, that day my mother and I had fought and I had went to my old appartment and in my old room my ex roommate had locked her dog in there and he shit all over all my shit. I was sooo upset that when I came home from my interview I changed my clothes and went to a friends house. I stayed there untill Mark calls over there and says you need to come home we need to talk.... So yesterday I was talkin to my mother and I found out that she is moving to PA if she doesnt have an appartment by July 8th... So of course I was upset about that... Then I confronted the person she would be moving in with and I told her how I felt about what she was doing to my family and she just didnt care and said that I was a selfish little bitch who didnt care about my mother. So needless to say I have had a very shitty few days."},

Simple positions, without  responsibility still require moral decisions.  Even As a bartender w are faced with these types of decisions.  We are told that we can not accept gifts or extensive tips from our customers, yet everyday I see my fellow cast members leaving with flowers and stuffed animals.  That certainly isn't a personal jet used for a lavish vacation, but are we looking at the future person who will abuse power given it?  And how do we positively influence these people?  Is their even hope?  They know what is right and what is wrong, yet they continue to work for their own self interest.  People in society constantly amaze me.  We give power to CEO's and they continue to use their influence and power on board members and others to get what they want.  How can we fix this?  We know what is right and wrong.  We have outlines and definitions of the morals in health care and the conflicts of interest.  We need to avoid hiring people who may put their own interest before that of the company.  But how do we identify these people?  Anyone can get through an interview with all the right answers given the proper research. I guess all we can do is limit power until we gain trust and positively influence others in our work place. "},

I never had I think.&lt;br />&lt;br />But it's not the kinda tearing apart self-pity crying, and it's not the crying that comes with a big black hole like when you have lost someone. It's the kind of crying that's like a big exclamation mark after the wonderful summer we've had together.&lt;br />&lt;br />I missed you when we were apart for two hours, and the weekend you were in \u00d6rebro was relatively easy to cope with because there came a monday after that weekend. This is bigger and I don't know what to do with myself.&lt;br />&lt;br />I've rolled up my sleeves, and the orange is waiting for me. I've also made a thermos of the tea that you bought in the beginning of the summer (chocolate and... whiskey?)&lt;br />&lt;br />When the train left I couldn't contain myself anymore. I had to go sit down, because standing up wasn't a good idea at that point.&lt;br />&lt;br />Later when I was waiting for the bus, I saw the sunrise, and god was it ever beautiful. It was like a big shining smile rising over the horizon. At that moment it felt like someone reassuring me, like it was communicating that all will be fine. It feels a little presumptuous to assume that we would have a sunrise dedicated to us, and nevertheless I feel that that was exactly what it was.&lt;br />&lt;br />Dangit! I'm still crying and it's making it damn hard to see what I type!&lt;br />&lt;br />Ooooooooh GOD I am looking forward to seeing you next time.&lt;br />&lt;br />I wish you well on your Dublin adventures, love.

It was a hearty belly-laughter. I smiled, because his joy rubbed off on me. We were standing at a crossroads. The landscape around us was open and the air was dry. At a distance the forest shot up from the ground like a green wall. The two roads were leading into the woods, one to the east and one to the north.&lt;br />&lt;br />Now he was smiling at me, red hair glowing in the setting sun.&lt;br />\"Well that is an easy question, my friend.\"&lt;br />\"Tell me the answer then\", I exclaimed, delighted that there was a solution to our problem.&lt;br />\"Not so fast\", he said. \"I will guide you, but I won't tell you what to do. Now what would be the purpose of that?\"&lt;br />&lt;br />Him and his games. If anything can be turned into a lesson or a game, be sure that he will do it. I took a drink of water from a bottle we had brought. &lt;br />&lt;br />\"Sooo...\", he said, the smile broadening. \"What shall we do?\"&lt;br />I shrugged. I didn't know - that's why I asked him in the first place.&lt;br />\"Begin at the beginning\", he suggested.&lt;br />&lt;br />I must have had a pained expression on my face, because he laughed again. &lt;br />\"Come on - try!\"&lt;br />\"Alright. We began... At home\", I said.&lt;br />\"Good. And then?\"&lt;br />\"We got on the bus. And then the train.\"&lt;br />\"Continue\", he encouraged me.&lt;br />\"A couple of hours later we got off the train, asked for directions and began to walk. The road down by the hotel and later the dirt road through the forest. We passed a couple of farms and a place where someone kept bees. Then we walked for another twenty minutes or so, and now we are here.\"&lt;br />\"Great!\", he said as if that cleared everything up.&lt;br />&lt;br />\"So I know how all this began\", I said. \"How is that going to help?\"&lt;br />\"Think for a minute. How come you know all this?\"&lt;br />\"Know what?\"&lt;br />\"How we got here!\"&lt;br />&lt;br />I was tempted to sit down and just forget everything for a while. He knew what I was thinking and started walking towards a cliff by the road. After a few seconds I followed him. He sat down on the cliff. I sat down and stretched out on the smooth surface. The sunset turned the sky red above the dark green silhouette of the trees. I don't know for how long we sat in silence.&lt;br />&lt;br />\"I know how we got here because we have already done it\", I said under my breath. He heard me.&lt;br />\"Good\", he said as if had known exactly when I was going to speak. He turned his head and his blue eyes looked into mine. \"So how will we choose path?\"&lt;br />\"By analyzing the past and try to draw knowledge from that? How are we going to do that? We have never been here before.\"&lt;br />\"No, no, no!\" He shook his head. \"If you did everything like you did it in the past you will end up where you began. Is that your goal?\"&lt;br />&lt;br />Surprisingly, the question didn't seem rhetorical. I knew that if I said yes, he would instantly change his course and help me get back.&lt;br />\"No. We agreed that would travel there, didn't we?\" I looked at him. \"Didn't we?\", I asked again.&lt;br />\"So we did, my friend. But then you see that we cannot let the past decide where we go. That would only lend us the same experience over and over.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />I thought. Then what was the point of making me think of the past? Riddles! Would that he at least once could tell me something without these riddles!&lt;br />&lt;br />\"We didn't know the journey before we began, but now we do.\"&lt;br />\"Both right and wrong\", he said.&lt;br />\"What? What was right and what was wrong?\"&lt;br />He leaned back.&lt;br />\"You are right, in the sense that we didn't know the experience of the journey before we began. We didn't know how the seat of that particular train would feel, or exactly who would sell us the ticket. We didn't experience the beauty of this sunset beforehand.&lt;br />    But wrong, in the sense that we did indeed know the journey.\" &lt;br />\"What, you mean that we planned to travel?\"&lt;br />\"Perhaps. What was in your mind when you decided to go on this journey?\"&lt;br />He leaned forward and looked me in the eyes.&lt;br />\"Think back. Wasn't the journey there?\"&lt;br />\"Oh I see! Yeah, kind of. But like an idea. Nothing as tangible as the experience of it.\"&lt;br />\"But when you stood there in the beginning, where did the journey exist?\"&lt;br />&lt;br />I thought. It didn't exist right then. That was the point, I was about to go on it. It didn't exist in any way that I know of.&lt;br />\"It existed in here!\", I said and touched my temple.&lt;br />\"Wrong. There is nothing in there.\"&lt;br />\"What?\"&lt;br />\"True. Ask a surgeon when you meet one. Any surgeon can tell you that when you remove the layers upon layers of brain, there is nothing in there.\"&lt;br />Okay, so he was joking in that special way of his. &lt;br />\"Look-\"&lt;br />He interrupted me.&lt;br />\"There are only three places where your journey could have existed.\"&lt;br />\"Three? What places?\"&lt;br />\"Well, where is it now?\"&lt;br />&lt;br />I realized what he was going for.&lt;br />\"Aha! The past!\"&lt;br />He smiled.&lt;br />\"Trick question, it exists now of course. Didn't you listen to me? 'Where is it now?', I asked. You are in it.\"&lt;br />\"Yeah, but what is done is done. That path which we walked lies behind us.\"&lt;br />He held up a finger.&lt;br />\"Look for the point. Don't miss the point.\"&lt;br />He waved his hand in the air as he talked.&lt;br />He said, \"The real question is, how did you know the path before you walked it?\"&lt;br />He folded his arms and sat back, waiting.&lt;br />&lt;br />I closed my eyes and went back. To the beginning, as he had told me. I remember having a feeling growing, a feeling that I wanted to go on a journey. I remember it taking form over the course of a few days. I couldn't quite see how it got there, that notion. It's almost as if it suddenly just was there. Like in snuck up on me. Then I remember planning, preparing. For what? For the journey. At the moment I wasn't sure if I had just made up the thought of a journey, just creating it, or if it was there waiting for me.&lt;br />\"I don't know\", I said. \"You have lost me I'm afraid. It seems the very idea of a journey was just there one day, like it had crept in my mind, hidden. One day I just saw it there.\"&lt;br />He leaned forward again.&lt;br />\"Saw it where?\"&lt;br />I hesitated. Three places. Back then it didn't exist in the past, of course. It wasn't present, like it was now.&lt;br />\"In... the future!\"&lt;br />\"Right you are!\"&lt;br />He looked extremely pleased with me. Or perhaps with his ability to nudge me around.&lt;br />\"Come!\", he said and stood up quickly. He ran over the small cliff and jumped down the last bit. He stood in the middle of the crossroads as I came up behind him.&lt;br />\"Now do it again\", he ordered.&lt;br />\"How do I do it?\", I asked.&lt;br />\"Well, now you know it. The magicians' way of choosing the path. Now do it.\"&lt;br />I frowned at him. Then I stopped. I looked at the sky. The sun was a mere hint of colour far away. A dark blue sky had opened up above me without me noticing. Stars shone above. I looked down at my feet, and then slowly followed one of the paths ahead with my eyes. Suddenly I noticed something I hadn't seen before. Footprints in the sand. Someone had walked here before. &lt;br />\"That's right\", he said. \"That is how the magician knows his path. When you don't know your path, you just have to look into the future and then follow your own footsteps.\"&lt;br />\"How did they get there?\", I asked.&lt;br />\"Why you put them there of course!\", he exclaimed. Then he added, \"In the beginning.\"&lt;br />He beamed at me. I glared at him, but couldn't quite keep the smile from my face. As usual.&lt;br />\"You...\", but I lacked words. Before I could think of any, he had lifted me of the ground, turned me a full circle and put me down in the direction of the footprints. As if I was light as a feather. Peering impishly at me, he began walking backwards down the road. &lt;br />\"Come!\", he said and turned around. \"Hurry! So much to see! So much to do! So many riddles to create for you!\""},

I did have a magnolia tree in the backyard which had split near the ground during the storm and half of it was leaning for an hour or so.  Then the wind shifted and the tree righted itself.  It looked OK, but I thought it was probably not really healthy.&lt;br />&lt;br />I also had a pine tree which had been leaning since I moved in in 1990 toward a neighbor's house.  Her house had been damaged by her own pine trees during Katrina and she had all the trees removed.  I decided that I should remove the pine tree and the magnolia.  This left me with more sunshine than ever and some nice piles of wood chips.&lt;br />&lt;br />I thought the wood chips might be good for compost and the extra sunshine might be nice for growing some vegetables.   Now I know that wood chips take a long time to decompose.  Anyway I made a couple of compost bins out of a roll of rabbit cage wire and started composting wood chips mixed with dirt.  I planted some bell peppers, jalepenos, okra, squash and tomatoes.  They ended up being in poor soil and the wood chips were pitiful compost, so they were weak plants.  I misjudged the amount of sunlight in that spot.  I got no squash at all.  I probably got 2 or 3 okra pods, a dozen small bell peppers, a couple dozen small tomatoes and maybe 4 dozen small jalepeno peppers.  My neighbor gave me some cucumber plants and they produced perhaps a dozen cucumbers.&lt;br />&lt;br />My neighbor enjoyed watching me work and helped me out a bit.  He's 90 years old and still gardening.  He kept giving me veggies all summer.   I received more veggies than I grew, but I was happy to have started a relationship with my neighbor and enjoyed his produce.  We had a lot of tomato and cucumber sandwiches.  I started enjoying adding jalepeno to the sandwiches.  The Katrina garden was a little pitiful but I did have some nice food to eat and something positive to do.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&lt;span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">Better Compost&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style=\"font-size: 100%;\">The first section of my garden had been in the area where my older son played basketball.  There was hard packed sandy soil.  Adding wood chips and planting in partial shade was altogether pretty silly.  I started cutting grass and composting grass clippings with some dirt.  After I had some better compost, I started digging a new area for planting.  I chose a little better. The new spot had grass growing and was in the sun.  The dirt looked much better and the compost was better.&lt;br />&lt;br />I planted yellow squash, cucumbers and okra in the second little plot.  I ended up with very large leaves on the squash plants and even had modest success with enough food to make it interesting.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold;\">Fruit Trees&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">&lt;span style=\"font-size: small;\">&lt;span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">The wood chips made poor compost for veggies, but I thought that perhaps they would work with trees.&amp;nbsp; I think they work best with \"wild\" type trees and vines.&amp;nbsp; So far it seems that wood chips are great for muscadines.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\" />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ph Meter&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-size: 100%;\">&lt;span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">&lt;span style=\"font-size: small;\">I have tried 2 different fairly cheap pH meters in my yard with total failure.&amp;nbsp; I think that I will be forced to guess and over time learn what works in my area.&amp;nbsp; I am fairly convinced that I have acidic soil, so I try to add lime depending on the plant's needs.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>"},

Speaking of fools. I know lots of them. For instance; there was a car accident today at school. This kid who lives up my road (I think he hates my guts...) he probably screeched out of the car park, like most of the drivers try to do and got barrelling down the road off to some unknown restaurant in order to purchase some desired greasy, fatty food for lunch. And then, come storming back to school, in the company of foolish friends and finish up the rest of the day absorbing knowledge like a sponge. Not. It was funnu though because I was walking home for lunch (I like two seconds away) and I heard a tremendous clatter and instantly thought \"Hah, it would be funny if someone went into the ditch.\" Only to hear ten minutes later from my thick as two short plants brother that someone had. Upon my return to school, he was sat on the bonnet of his faded red Jeep Cherokee with a solumn look upon his sunglassed obscured face. Indeed the noon-hour today happened with great incident."},

Theres a couple things I have observed that have been on my mind.&lt;br />&lt;br />BRIDGE! I love Bridge and its goals.  This program at Davis is meant to inspire Filipino students, if not all students, to pursue higher education.  I went to their 10th annual showcase this Saturday cuz my sister said they were inviting past board members.  I haven't been out to anything Bridge in so long so I thought hey, why not.  My sister and Stephen came too...yay one of my best guy friends and former board member.  WE felt old, as expected.  There were too many singing groups, also as expected.  But they were pretty good!  The one thing I was irritated with the whole night was the MC.  The guy MC kept talking about his after party and drinking/getting drunk at the after party, and being \"moist and wet\" from watching the performers.  1) There were parents there.  2) PYC youth were invited (all of high school age)  3) There was even a young performer there age 12 that was watching the show too.  What the hell kind of message are they sending to these kids? It makes it look like Bridge is trying to encourage kids to come to college cus its fun and you get to drink.  What is this? It's one thing for the performers to talk about that stuff, but the MC-- that reflects poorly on Bridge....upsetting.&lt;br />&lt;br />Whew...next more pressing thing.  I have a performance this Sunday.  It's a hula performance and it's making me alil bit nerviosa!  This Sunday, Feb 27  at 12pm at the San Ramon Multicultural Festival.  It should be fun and it's free for all watchers hehe.  So cmon out!  I rarely have nething that I want people to come out n watch...AND it's free woohoo!.  I'm nervous, I just hope I don't get too nervous during the show.  So practice practice practice..whew should be vewy intewesting hehe....gotta go clean some stuff now...whew!"},

Sniff... Cough... Wahoo\"&lt;/span>&lt;/strong>&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br />Ahh long time no see. I gotta say I do still love my blog, it\u2019s always there for yah even if you\u2019ve neglected it... your few readers however... well the blog is still there though. Plus it doesn\u2019t complain or ask for anything in return... except well id be pretty ticket is some blogger gave me a hideous layout with hearts and black and red font.&lt;br />&lt;br />My neglect comes with a good excuse sickness \u2013 &lt;strong>Tegan and Sara concert&lt;/strong> \u2013 sickness \u2013 sickness. A) people who go shopping when their sick should be shot. The only thing they do is spread their disease around. Working in retail I have to continually wash my hands worried that the countless sick people that into the store during flu season will spread their disease. They fondle the merchandise and peruse the shelves \u2013 do they ever buy anything? no. Why? Because they are sick, they don\u2019t care about decorating their home, they are just so tired of being sick they get bored and think, HEY i\u2019m healthy enough to leave me home... WRONG. You are not, stay at home, get the rest of your family sick, I don\u2019t know you, and I don\u2019t want your germs. So it\u2019s inevitable with my endless hand scrubbing that I would get sick. I would however understand it if they were shopping because they needed to buy a present or some urgent reason why they would leave their homes, but that\u2019s never the case. So to all you sick people who go to movies, and go shopping, or to a restaurant while your sick STOP it you selfish wank.&lt;br />&lt;br />Moving on... &lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\"> &lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\"> &lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\"> &lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\">&lt;strong>&lt;span style=\"font-size:130%;color:#ff0000;\">Tegan and Sara \"Waahoo\"&lt;/span>&lt;/strong>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\"> &lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\">&lt;br />&lt;img alt=\"Tegan Quinn\" src=\"http://img30.exs.cx/img30/4844/tegan28dd.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\" /> Last Wednesday was the Tegan and Sara concert at reds. It was fantastic it was the first time I had ever sent hem play live which is amazing because I have admired them since their hit \u201cThe First\u201d got radio play. So Matt and myself trot out our houses around 5pm to go pick up the tickets that we ordered online months ago. When I got there the lady at ticket master said If I would have been a minute later my tickets would have been printed out at Reds, and given away to another customer... kind of a bullshit system if you think about it, and I still doubt that, that would be the case. So with the tickets in hand we headed to West Edmonton Mall only to look at the tickets to see the doors opened at 8pm. Since it was around 5:30 at the time I suggested we waited and went to Matt\u2019s house to kill time there. Instead we went to the Mall thinking it would be better to kill time there... we were wrong. We ate yummy subs and then walked around mindlessly \u2013 since both Matt and I are broke it was a bit tedious. Now I really wish we went to Matt\u2019s house just because walking around and then waiting in line only completely drained us of all energy (damn I\u2019m getting old). We met some friends in line who were there and ahead in line (yes we butted I\u2019m an ass get over it). We only had to wait about 30 minutes in line before they started to let people in. Little did we know reds went through the first 20 people in line and took their tickets ahead of time to stop people from budding sop when we got to the security the guy bumped us to the back of the line. So I was pissed right off, since the lined had progressed about 200 people back. So we waited about 30 more minutes again, by the time we made it back our other friends told us he took the tickets of the people behind us \u2013 so the guy was just having a power trip, and wanted to be an ass. That\u2019s Red\u2019s for yah. &lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\"> &lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\">The crowd in reds was pretty diverse, packed with teenage Emo kids and some older people around my age. So by this time I was getting pretty pumped, Reds played clips from America\u2019s Funniest Home Video\u2019s on their big screen while we waited, and finally Lindy came out to play. Now I don\u2019t really understand why some band\u2019s pick the openers they do. By rights an opener should get people pumped, not be too long, but long enough to expose their music and vibe to the crowd, entertain them for the time it takes to do so, and still get them pumped for the show ahead. Lindy did none of these things. There was little stage charisma, and their musical style seemed like wannabe Belle and Sebastian, the band itself spent more time looks at their instruments and the floor than conversing with the crowd. Their set seemed long and drawn out, leaving the crowd to converse with themselves and wonder when their suffering would end. Well, actually that\u2019s been a little harsh; they weren\u2019t horrible they just seemed like one of those bands that would be better via CD. SO by the time they were done, I was completely drained, having been standing for 4 hours now, and being old and sick. It was pretty neat to see both Tegan and Sara come out to watch Lindy play their set. I was so surprised to see how short they both were, which only made them look more cute. Plus you could completely get the vibe that they don\u2019t think their huge celebrities with ego, they had no problem coming out to watch their opener. So once they got on set all my tiredness and aches went away and was replaced with musical bliss. All I have to say is wow. I was so happily surprised at how great they sounded live, even better than they do on album. They seem to be able to play anything from electric guitar to keyboards and acoustic. Both the twins switched in and out during their set between instruments. Reds however has some sound issues and their techies had some mic issues, so the fact that they sounded amazing over all that I was extremely impressed. They carried themselves on stage with perfection. They have immense charisma with their band mates and themselves. Plus they carry and aura towards their fans that they are truly grateful for the support and had mentioned many times throughout the show that, that was indeed the case. Apparently that show was the biggest crowd they had played too that was just them headlining, which I thought was pretty neat. I also thought it was pretty cool when someone yelled out a song request from the crowd and mentioned it was their Birthday, so Tegan got everyone in the crowd to yell happy birthday until she saw everyone yell. Comparing them to other female artists I had seen live they treat each and every fan as if they would treat a friend, they have absolutely no ego, which makes their live shows quite enjoyable. Especially because you don\u2019t need all that crap, you don\u2019t need rehearsed \u201ctalking to the crowd bits\u201d they talked naturally, and once they played you saw their passion for the music which must be so hard to do night after night playing the same songs. They do it in a way that you believe that they make music that they love, and it makes u love it even more. I would love to see what a cd with the production quality that Jennifer Lopez gets staring T&amp;amp;S because their live range was amazing, and it just doesn\u2019t show on their albums.&lt;br />&lt;br />Their set was a mix of new and old, with quite a variety. They also finished the show with a song I had never heard before which was a treat. All in all I give it a 5 star show. not only am I thankful I got the chance to see them live, but also that there is someone out there so talented that actually has a fan base that allows them to make music. They are only going to get bigger and bigger, whether or not they ever make a huge success in the Much Music world. Go see them now. Check out their site for the rest of Canadian tour dates, and get all your friends to go with.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;strong>&lt;a href=\"http://www.teganandsara.com/index.php\">Official Site&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />ps. \u201cI told u so\u201d \u2013 Grammy awards (friggin U2)&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;strong>-J&lt;/strong> &lt;/div>"},

Having done this twice before, I have a better feel for where to go, where not to go, and how to pace my trip.&lt;br />&lt;br />Armed with my trusty laptop, this time around I can blog as I go and give you daily updates - just like a real journalist would!&lt;br />&lt;br />I left Calgary just after 10AM.. After a quick stop in Golden for some lunch, I made it into the Okanagan around 4:00PM local time.. Since it was early enough and it was on the way, I figured I'd stop in at Arrowleaf cellars - a great way to start my trip, being that they're one of my favorite wineries here..&lt;br />&lt;br />I tasted about 5 of the usual suspects:&lt;br />&lt;br />White Feather - their house white blend - a nice quaffable white - not a lot of depth here, but great for patio season.&lt;br />&lt;br />Red Feather - my favorite wine here - their Rose blend - after some sweet-talking, I managed to get my hands on a half a case of the as yet unreleased 2006 vintage (already a silver medal winner) - primarily Pinot Noir and Chardonnay this year.   Looking forward to the hot weather to drink some of this!&lt;br />&lt;br />Chardonnay - a decent Okanagan chard - very little oak, unlike so many of the bottles coming out of California&lt;br />&lt;br />Solstice - their red blend, primarily Merlot and Zweigelt.. I wasn't blown away, but I'm usually not by their reds.  They just seem better at the whites and rose.&lt;br />&lt;br />Vidal (I cant remember the name - its new for them) - it's an off-dry white - the grapes are picked at the same time as the one they use for their late-harvest vidal, so you can guess that the sugar content is pretty high to start with.  I assumed that they fermented it for a bit longer to get the excess sugar out - this seemed to be confirmed by the relatively high 13.6% alcohol content..&lt;br />&lt;br />All in all, I walked out of Arrowleaf with a case of wine for myself and some friends..&lt;br />&lt;br />After Arrowleaf, I headed straight into downtown Kelowna to check into the Royal Anne Hotel - I like this hotel - reasonably priced, and just a block from the waterfront.  And - it's a nice 5 block walk away from...&lt;br />&lt;br />Bouchons Bistro.  Ahhhh...&lt;br />&lt;br />Once again, my love affair with this restaurant has been rekindled for another year.  I walked in a little before 7, and as always, the owner / Maitre'd was out front to greet me - showed me to a table on the patio.  Over the next 90 minutes, I was back in culinary heaven..   I started out with French onion soup simmered with Chablis, paired up with a glass of Alstian Geuwurtztraminer.   Following that was a duo of duck leg confit, with some mushrooms sauteed with pork belly, some seasonable vegetables, and of course the obligatory pommes frites (this is a brasserie style restaurant after all).. I paired that up with a glass of Quail's Gate Reserve Pinot Noir, which worked nicely.   I followed up the main course with a chilled lavendar souflee with passionfruit puree, paired up with a glass of their house sauternes.   Add on an espresso, and I was 'fini'.&lt;br />&lt;br />I followed up that fabulous meal with a trip to the casino.. I think I will now write a book of my experiences, titled \"How to lose at blackjack like a professional\".. Up until tonight, I didn't think it would be possible to lose so much money while holding 19 or 20 in your hand.  Fortunately, the other gents at the table were having similar luck.&lt;br />&lt;br />So, now its time to retire for the evening, and prepare for Day 2.   Saturday is my day to conquer the southern Okanagan, and hopefully squeeze in a couple more good meals to boot.&lt;br />&lt;br />Cheers!"},

Tues Aug 9th, 2005&lt;br />&lt;br />It was a game that the Dazzlers more-or-less needed to win against the first place Panthers. A victory wouldn't guarantee promotion to the next division, but a loss would more-or-less knock it on the head.&lt;br />&lt;br />But the omens weren't great from the beginning: nervous emails flying around in the hours running up to the match;uncharacteristic squabbling out on the field in the first few innings; Isaac cracking his rib just a few days before; the trip down to south London which always seems to send everyone's internal compass doo-lally as soon as they cross the river; plus the Yankees not being able to get a handle on those damn Bosox... it all proved too much, even for a Dazzlers team that arrived early for some pre-game warm-up and practice, riding high on the wave of an exciting win the week before.&lt;br />&lt;br />And so, against the background of sun-kissed young lovers sunbathing and frolicking shamelessly on an unusually beautiful evening as the streaming sunshine blazed through the leaves and onto the rich green grass of Clapham Common, the team took the field to... come to think of it, what the hell were we doing playing softball in the first place???&lt;br />&lt;br />The details aren't important. In fact, it's probably better not to go into them. The mishandled ground balls, the overthrows, the scoreless innings at the plate... whatever. There were some bright spots, like Amy's sizzling liner down the 3rd base line in the top of the 1st; Sam's sky-high tape-measure shot to left field that almost hit the Space Shuttle on its way back down to earth; Rob's fantastic grab in deep, deep right-center field (even if it was obviously only due to the magic little pair of white shoes that he had just put on).&lt;br />&lt;br />Mostly, though, it seems all a blur. And an unfair end to what had been a great season, in an unexpectedly competitive division. But if it is any compensation, it wasn't just that the Dazzlers got beat by a better team. There was a little bit more poetry in it than that. The opposing first-place Panthers were the development team the year before Tony and Gerard put the &lt;br />Dazzlers together. They had that little bit of extra seasoning that the Dazzlers will hopefully pick up next year. They were one year more mature, been round it one extra loop, this was their 3rd stab at it. Their time had come. They were ready to reap the benefits of the hard work they had invested, the experience they had accumulated. I mean, c'mon. they're a great bunch of people and they deserved it, didn't they? Ah, um, didn't they...?&lt;br />&lt;br />Finsbury Dazzlers 3 1 3 0 0 0 1 - 08&lt;br />Sumatra Panthers 8 3 4 6 1 4 x - 26"},

It really is most shameful of me, and I'm sure you won't make do with the excuse that I've been very busy! I will try and remember as much as I can of what has happened since my last post, but those of you who know me well will know that my memory isn't the best in the world, so forgive me if I leave anything out and have to edit the post at a later date!&lt;br />&lt;br />I guess the main bit of news since my last update is that a couple of weeks ago, I was rejected without an interview from the university of my dreams, Oxford. I was absolutely devastated at the time, though I'm beginning to see it in a more philosophical light now. I was at school when I got the news; first thing on a Friday morning, and we'd been let out of English early, so I went to the common room, which thankfully was nearly empty. I got a text from my dad saying that a letter had arrived from Lincoln College, so I phoned him and asked him to open it and read it out to me. Imagine, if you will, how stunned I was when he read out the words:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 255); font-style: italic;font-family:Georgia;\" >\"Unfortunately, in view of the overall competition for places this year and after consultation with other colleges, I am sorry to have to tell you that we shall not be able to offer you a place at Oxford and that your application is no longer under consideration by any of the colleges here.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/span>My initial reaction was to think that it was some kind of awful joke on my dad's part. But no, that would be too cruel. The next thing I did was to burst into tears, run out of the common room, sign out of school ill and wander in a dazed, aimless fashion in the direction of the station (still crying my eyes out and attracting some weird looks from passers-by), to go home. I phoned Alan, who was too shocked to say anything. I didn't stop crying for about an hour and a half. I phoned Jason, who was very supportive and sympathetic and advised me to go out and buy a new pair of shoes, which I did.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"color: rgb(102, 51, 255);\">Change of font colour as it's now over two months since I wrote the above! My lovely Alan is in Japan for *five weeks* and the time difference means that we don't get to talk very much, and thus I have time on my hands and am resurrecting this blog. More on that later, in the meantime I had better update you with what's been going on since that fateful day when I was rejected from Oxford!&lt;br />&lt;br />My teachers did all they could to try and persuade Lincoln College to give me an interview, but alas, to no avail. It was a sad day when we finally had to give up hope, but with hindsight I'm feeling more philosophical about it - in a way, I'm quite relieved that I didn't have to go through the pressure of the infamous Oxford interview, not to mention that if I had got in, I would probably have got very fed up with the amount of work after a while. I'm glad I won't have to go through all that stress, when going to university will be stressful enough as it is.&lt;br />&lt;br />I have had offers from Reading and York, a rejection from Warwick (more on this later!), and I'm still waiting to hear from Durham and Nottingham. My plan initially was to take a year out and reapply to Cambridge, but I've now realised that would be a waste of time, and having been on an open day to Reading University, I've decided to go there. I don't need GCSE Spanish to go there, so I've dropped that and now I get to come home at 11.30am on Thursdays (as opposed to 5.15pm!), which is brilliant! The good thing about Reading is that I can live with Alan whilst doing my degree, which will be excellent. Again, more on this later!&lt;br />&lt;br />The main event since then has been my trip to France over the Christmas holidays. That was quite an experience! Having said goodbye to Alan (always a horrid moment) when he went to France before Christmas, I then joined him in France on December 28, sailing from Portsmouth to St Malo on a cheap overnight crossing. Remarkably, I managed to find my way around the ferry without getting lost, and I met Alan at St Malo the next morning without event. We went to Mt St Michel (I would post photos if I knew how!), a lovely kind of island thing joined to the mainland, with a monastery on top. There was a small street winding round the island leading up to it, and the place had a great atmosphere, like the kind of place you might see on a Christmas card. Unfortunately, my enjoyment of it was hindered slightly by excruciating period pains, and I have a photo of me looking very glum sitting in the main chapel in great pain!&lt;br />&lt;br />That afternoon, we drove back to Alan's parents' place, which is near Vannes in Brittany. I was *so* nervous! I don't speak any French, and they don't speak any English, which just made it worse. I must confess that it took me several days before I started to relax, though there were moments when I was able to be myself a bit more (such as after dinner, when Alan's mum produced loads of Alan's baby photos - sooooo cute! And when Alan's brother, his wife, Alan and I played a kind of board game and I won, even though it was the first time I'd played... don't think Alan was too pleased, as he's played it lots of times but never won!).&lt;br />&lt;br />The food was rather an ordeal! I don't eat that much at the best of times, so faced with meals the size and richness of those, I was not a particularly happy bunny! Perhaps the worst moment for me in terms of food came when a bowl of shrimps arrived on the table. Whole shrimps, with their little eyes staring up at me. The idea was to pull their heads off (gross gross gross!), then peel the legs and shell off, before dipping them in mayonnaise and eating them like that. I was horrified, and looked round to see what everyone else was doing, and they were all tucking into them heartily, so I had no option but to do the same. I found the shells to be very weird, so that I couldn't tell whether they were really hot or really cold... or maybe it wasn't the nature of the shells, maybe it was just me. Anyhow, I was proud of how I handled them, gritting my teeth and bearing it, with bread to help them down. I'm not overly keen to eat them again though, I must say!&lt;br />&lt;br />After staying a couple of days in Vannes, we went to a little village called Binic, on the north coast of Brittany not far from St Malo. This is where Alan's sister and her family live, and where we stayed two nights to celebrate the New Year. The festivities commenced at around 8pm, when we had several courses of food (including more shrimps, alas!) which I thought would never end, culminating in ice cream served with a liqueur which is meant to help you digest quickly so that you can go on eating more! Alan's sister and I didn't have any of that as we don't drink alcohol, but everyone else did. I couldn't believe that! I was relieved, then, when at about 11.30pm we went for a walk to the beach to let off some fireworks. I needed a break from all that eating! The kids were really excited and were being very noisy, and I frankly just wanted to spend some time alone with Alan! We couldn't though, which kind of pissed me off to be honest, but nevermind. After midnight, we went walking round the village, the kids yelling \"bonne ann\u00e9e\" all the way. I thought people would get annoyed with them, but a guy leant out of his window and shouted &lt;/span>&lt;span style=\"color: rgb(102, 51, 255);\">\"bonne ann\u00e9e\" back to us!  It was a great atmosphere, and certainly my most memorable New Year's Night so far.&lt;br />&lt;br />When we got back, it was loud music, the kids going insane dancing to it, and then more food. By this time I was beginning to get really rather pissed off, as I was tired, I'd already eaten far too much food, and I really wanted to be alone with Alan. But no, I had to endure several more courses, and by the time we eventually got to bed at about 3am, I was exhausted and as soon as we were behind closed doors I started crying again, *is ashamed of self*. To add insult to injury, we were sleeping on a horrid old camp bed, which took ages to pump up and then gradually deflated over the next few hours meaning that we had to get up in the middle of the night to pump it up again. Not only that, but every single tiny movement one made produced a massive noise! I think they must have given it to us as some kind of joke!&lt;br />&lt;br />The next day we slept in until about 1pm, which was a source of amusement for Alan's family. I forget how we spent the afternoon, but as some people left I remember beginning to feel a bit more relaxed, and having fun with Alan's nephews and niece. In the evening after the kids had gone to bed, we adults sat down for a meal (yes, more food!!), only for the lights to start switching on and off before finally not coming back on at all! Looking out the window, the entire village appeared to have had the power cut too, so everywhere was pitch black! This was soon followed by the children getting upset, because they were frightened of the dark. Alan's sister and her husband managed to find some candles, and we sat down by candlelight (was actually really quite romantic!) to continue eating. Typically, having spent some minutes lighting all those candles, the electricity returned a couple of minutes later and the lights came back on!&lt;br />&lt;br />The following morning we said goodbye to Alan's sister and her family and started the bit I was really looking forward to - the journey to Paris. Six hours or so of time spent just the two of us! On the way there, we drove through Versailles, which was absolutely awesome! It was dark by the time we got there, and the palace was lit up and looked fabulous - I definitely want to go back for a proper visit some day! The streets were all lit with Christmas lights, and it looked wonderful.&lt;br />&lt;br />We arrived at Alan's brother's house a little later that evening, and I liked it because it was a lot quieter following the noise of Alan's sister's kids (though don't get me wrong, they were great - just in moderation!)! We spent those last two days in Paris, which is the best city I've ever been to (but I agree, I've not visited that many!). We saw lots of very famous places, and I was ashamed of myself for acting like a tourist and getting all excited over seeing the Eiffel Tower for the first time! We went right to the top, and the view was breathtaking! We then went to the top of the Arc de Triumph, which was considerably harder work than the lifts which take one to the top of the Eiffel Tower - it was a spiral staircase, which seemed to go up, and up, and up forever! I had the misfortune of having hiccups all the way up too, so there was me out of breath and the sound of my hiccups resonating through the stairwell thanks to the stone walls and floor! However, the struggle up those stairs was worth it for the spectacular view of Paris by night, including the Eiffel Tower lit up! It was really wonderful, and I didn't want to leave!&lt;br />&lt;br />Other places we went to in Paris included Montmatre, which had an amazing atmostphere, what with the guy sitting playing the harp (gave the place such an air of culture!) and all the artists waiting to paint/draw people's portraits. The view of Paris from there was spectacular, too. We went round Notre Dame cathedral, which was also very impressive, as well as seeing the Moulin Rouge (from the outside). The street which the Moulin Rouge is on is extremely dodgy, as it is lined with sex shops - more than I've ever seen in my life! (ok, confession time... I don't think I'd ever seen a sex shop before then! :-0) I actually felt quite scared to be there after dark (we had to so that we could take photos of the Moulin Rouge when it's all lit up... though we took some pics of the sex shops too, just because there were so many!)!&lt;br />&lt;br />I'm sure there are other things I meant to write about Paris - it was certainly a packed couple of days! I loved Paris and didn't want to leave - two days weren't long enough, that's for sure! I hope to go back some day, though in the meantime there are many, many other places I'd like to visit, so I won't waste time by revisiting somewhere I've already been for now! We managed to get an earlier ferry home to England, sailing from Calais, though it was in the middle of the night and the ferries were running late due to adverse weather conditions. Once on board, we headed for one of the lounges, where having had a cup of hot chocolate Alan went to sleep, and I was left not really knowing what to do, as I hadn't thought of bringing a book, and I'm not fortunate enough to be able to sleep whenever and wherever I want! I had a look round some of the shops on the ferry, and made the mistake of trying on some perfumes. Why was this a mistake, I hear you ask? I'm sure it would have been fine had it been the daytime (ie, had I been able to see outside so that I could see the motion of the ship), but as it was the middle of the night I couldn't see the horizon, and whilst initially the up and down movement of the ship thanks to the rough sea was fairly exciting, the novelty soon wore off and I began to feel very sick. The heady smell of the perfume just made me feel ten times worse, and as soon as we were back in the car, I washed it off with bottled water! I shan't be making that mistake again!&lt;br />&lt;br />My overall feelings about the trip were good: it was quite an experience, and there were some very memorable moments. I did wish on many occasions, however, that I had been able to spend more time alone with Alan, as we did in Cornwall. It was great to meet his family at last, despite the communication problems, but given the choice I would certainly have opted for a holiday for just the two of us! We are planning on going to Italy over the summer, which I'm greatly looking forward to. I really want to see the world!&lt;br />&lt;br />I had better say a few words about one or two things which happened before I left for France! My dad took my friend Hannah and me to see Handel's Messiah in Bath just before Christmas, which we both enjoyed greatly. It was nice to see so many people I know (including the evil guy I dated a few times a couple of years ago, Nathan; though he was pretty charming on that particular occasion), in particular Jason (who was conducting) and my best friend from choir, Claire. I loved the music, and it was nice to go to a concert as a member of the audience for a change!&lt;br />&lt;br />The end of term at school didn't really feel like the end of term, and was distinctly lacking in the Christmas spirit which had been such a feature of the previous year. This was because our sadistic headteacher banned anything to do with Christmas, even down to tinsel in the hair, even on the very last day of term. He also limited the number of carols sung in the end of term assembly to one (Hark the Herald Angels Sing, a nice religious one), which was not met with popular approval. I played in the band and happily occupied the role of principal flute, a pleasant improvement on last year when my arch nemesis Katherine took on the role. The day after the end of term my friends and I went to Gill's 18th birthday party, which was basically just a pizza and video evening and swapping Christmas presents. I didn't enjoy it much, as I never really enjoy being in groups of more than three or four people. I find it intimidating!&lt;br />&lt;br />Corsley Choir is going well. Our concert at the beginning of December seemed to be a success, though I must admit I found the repertoire rather boring. Natalie came to the concert, and I introduced her to the famous John. I was in turn introduced to John's wife and John's wife's mother, and I found that his wife was really nice! I've since come to the conclusion that John seems more of a family man than he likes to make out sometimes, and he's finally learnt to kiss me on the cheek and not on the lips. So good progress there! We are now singing the Mozart Requiem (and will be singing the Ave Verum too), which I'm really excited about. I'm finding it harder than I expected, but I love the music so much that I don't find that problematic in the slightest! I have also been getting on well with Jason recently, although Rachel has had to tell him off for being too sarcastic with me (he claims I find it funny because I always laugh, which sadly is true... he is funny!)!&lt;br />&lt;br />I suppose the most major event before France was Christmas, which was enjoyable (though I would have liked to have been with Alan on Christmas Day, but nevermind! I hopefully will be this year!). My uncle Michael came on the day as he usually does, so that was fun. We went for a nice walk with the dog and took lots of photos, and in the evening watched a film (I can't remember what it was we watched!). On Boxing Day some old neighbours of ours came for lunch, which is something they always do and something which I personally find rather a bore.&lt;br />&lt;br />A notable absence from the Christmas festivities was my grandparents. This is because we are unfortunately no longer on good terms with them. Entirely their choice, and sparked off by events which began with the death of my great grandmother. My mum and I represented our part of the family at the funeral in November, and while we were there we met lots of relatives (many of whom I never knew existed) with whom we decided we would like to remain in contact. This appeared to be Grandad's intention too, for the relatives in question are his brothers (my great uncles), who have been estranged for many years for various reasons too complicated to go into. To cut a long story short, Nanny had other ideas, and very soon she had taken offence at my mum wanting to be on friendly terms with Grandad's brothers, and announced that they would not be spending Christmas with us, which they have done for as long as I can remember. Since then things have escalated, and they've announced that they're not going to speak to us again, which I frankly find ridiculous and hurtful. I never expected to fall out with them, and it's a great pity. They seem determined not to listen to any talk from us of reconciliation, and it seems that they have made their minds up and there is nothing we can do about it. So that's that! :-(&lt;br />&lt;br />January was very busy, what with revising for my geography resit exam. I spent a free period with Mrs Hand, who very kindly gave me a file and organised all my geography notes for me, so that I knew which ones I had to revise from (otherwise I'd have wasted time revising for stuff which wouldn't come up on the paper!). In the end, I don't know how the exam went - one never can tell! - but I'm not too bothered about it because I still got a B overall, and if it's any worse than last time I don't need to take the grade, I can keep the first one. At the end of January I went to Warwick University for an interview, which went disasterously. I didn't like the interviewer and she (why couldn't it have been a guy, they're so much easier to talk to!) clearly didn't like me, and asked lots of questions which didn't leave much scope for very stimulating replies, not to mention that she asked me about a book I'd mentioned in my personal statement which I hadn't finished reading, so I couldn't talk about it at all because she was asking about the ending. All in all it was a disaster, and I ended up disliking the university as a whole owing to that unpleasant experience. I didn't stay for the sample lectures, I just went straight home! As predicted I was rejected, and it's just a good job I didn't want to go there!&lt;br />&lt;br />My job at the cafe I mentioned is going well. I'm still doing it, remarkably (I've been wanting to leave), though I do find it very hard work and stressful. It's rather making me appreciate Longleat! Incidentally, I did get that bonus I spoke of in my last entry! \u00a3108! They also paid me \u00a3120 of holiday pay, so that was great - it worked out really well in the end! My mum applied for a job there this year, but sadly didn't get the job because there were an incredible thirty applicants just for six places! I don't think it can have been that competitive last year, when I was applying for the job, otherwise I doubt I would have got the job.&lt;br />&lt;br />At the beginning of this month (February) I had my A level recital, which was traumatic. I played the Telemann Viola Concerto, Glasunow \"Elegie\" (also for viola) and \"Idylle\" by Benjamin Godard (for flute), and Gerry, the guy who accompanies Corsley Choir, accompanied me, which was great as I get on very well with him. The recital could have gone worse, but it could also have gone a lot better. My viola playing really let me down, and the question on everyone's lips after the recital was why didn't I do the whole recital on the flute! The answer being that I was advised by people who know better than me about these things not to do the recital on the flute, since I no longer have lessons. Let's face it, I hadn't played the flute properly for over a year, and yet my playing was still infinitely superior to my viola playing, despite having lessons most weeks. I have no decided I'm going to do the recital again, but entirely on the flute, and I'm having a flute lesson with Jonathan as a birthday present from my parents (it's horrendously expensive) in order to help me prepare. I'm quite excited about that!&lt;br />&lt;br />The state of my health has been somewhat less exciting. My cough having returned, I began to experience a shortness of breath about which I went to see the doctor and was then diagnosed with some kind of asthma. I now have to have an inhaler, which is a pain, and some time in the next few days I will be having to go to the hospital to have a chest x-ray, which is annoying. I just hope it doesn't reveal anything potentially nasty!&lt;br />&lt;br />It was half term last week and I spent the week with Alan, naturally. I went to his place on Friday night, but unfortunately came down with a really severe fever, and spent the whole of the next day and much of Sunday as well in bed. On Monday it was Valentine's Day, and Alan and I went to collect the gorgeous ring he has bought me, which was very exciting! It's a pink sapphire gem with a diamond either side, and I'm still captivated by the way it sparkles in the light! In the afternoon, we dressed up in smart clothes (he looked absolutely gorgeous in his suit.... I felt so proud to be with him!) and set off somewhere (I didn't, at that point, know where we were going!). It turned out that we were going to London, to a Valentine's concert given by the London Concert Orchestra at the Barbican Hall! It was tremendously exciting, although I got very cold on the streets of London and my shoes weren't the most comfortable in the world! It was worth it though, and it was a super evening. We even made it back to Oxford in time to go to Domino's Pizza before it closed at midnight, hurrah!&lt;br />&lt;br />The rest of the week, Alan had to be at work during the day, so I worked on my coursework back in his room, which was boring and claustrophobic, but worth it to be able to spend the evenings and nights together. I can assure you, however, that you do *not* want to get me started on the subject of his landlady, so I shall say no more about her than that. Last Wednesday, we went to look at an apartment in Abingdon, just south of Oxford, and decided very quickly that it's the place for us, so we've reserved it! It's so exciting! It's a really nice top floor apartment with a great kitchen, and we'll be moving into it when it becomes available in May (though I won't be able to live there until the end of May when I go on study leave, but it's only a few weeks!). I shall then be commuting from Abingdon to Reading when I'm at university. It's all happening at the moment! :-D&lt;br />&lt;br />Except that technically, it's not all happening, since Alan is in Japan for five weeks. He left on Saturday and won't be back until March 27th (when I will be meeting him at Heathrow), which, though exciting for him, is almost unbearable for me because we hardly get to talk at all because of the time difference (Japan is nine hours ahead) and because he only gets internet access when he's at work. I can't believe it's going to be so long before I see him again... in fact, it seems like an eternity. I've felt really depressed over the last few days, and I didn't expect to find this so difficult to cope with. I think I'm beginning to come to terms with it, but the prospect of the next few weeks seems frightfully gloomy (in particular when he leaves Kyoto and will only have internet access sporadically... his phone doesn't work in Japan, so we'll be totally without means of communication). *sigh* It's really testing me to the limits, and on top of everything else I'm kind of jealous that he gets to travel to so many interesting places.... I just really hope I will be as lucky some day.&lt;br />&lt;br />It has been snowing here a lot today, and BBC News Online (a site to which I've been addicted since Alan left because I've got nothing else to do) informs me that the worst is yet to come. I really crave somewhere warm at the moment, or at the very least I crave the arrival of summer!&lt;br />&lt;br />I shall sign off here, for this entry is now ridiculously long; congratulations if you have made it this far! I'll try and update again soon.&lt;br />&lt;/span>"},

Lots of fun and I wont even try to review it here. But what is it missing, multiplayer? Well no, the genius behind Oblivion is the very nature of the single player experience. But after playing World of Warcraft and getting used to being *part* of a community thats what I really miss. Playing Oblivion feels lonely.&lt;br />&lt;br />Has WoW ruined single player games for me? Has the feeling of belonging to a Guild ruined the enjoyment of a lone experience? And solo questing doesnt count as a truly lone experience - I'd estimate that a very large percentage of all inter-personal interaction between players on WoW is not directly related to the quest or adventure being played by the people chatting away. People chat about how to beat a mob, or how cool your latest gear is, perhaps discuss raid tactics or your latest spec lists. Often the conversation mutates into interesting but nonetheless unrelated topics such as your latest gadgets, where you're going on holiday or what your favourite artist is up to. Thats the thing - its a community&lt;br />&lt;br />Perhaps WoW has ruined single player games. But how about this - introduce the feeling of an online community into the existing Oblivion game using a 'chat' mod. Imagine playing Oblivion but having access to a similiar type of chat function as in WoW. Form and join guilds, interact online with friends while playing Oblivion, get tips on the quests and the world....think of it as WoW but in a very large 1 player instance.&lt;br />&lt;br />I reckon that would be fun, and if some intrepid developer comes up with the mod, I'll pay a dollar for it!&lt;br />&lt;/span>"},

Although I had a kick arse time in Montreal and Debs was an incredible hostess I missed my bed and the random dog hair which normally covers all my clothing. Naturally after any sort of short holiday/trip Aiya and I have a debriefing session. You know, just to catch up on what heinous things Ammi and Thathi have been up to. Naturally one thing leads to another and we either end up watching a stupid WIll Ferrell/Ben Stiller vehicle, or revert to our castle in the sky. Last night we decided on the latter. (For those of you who are unfamiliar with our castle in the sky. For shame!

Given my inability to see a piece of paper, or napkin without writing on it, we naturally had an impromptu handwriting analysis session. Which really blew because I couldn't remember how to analyse jack ;) But I hunted up the original analysis test and re-did it (today). Is it still disgustingly accurate? You bet! Joycie and Abs were wondering about the scientific accuracy of these things, and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot, but here's some useful sites. &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphology\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia's take on things&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href=\"http://myhandwriting.com/FAQ/\" target=\"_blank\">FAQ&lt;/a> from the place I did the analysis from.

Investigates things rapidly b/c of intense curiosity. Extremely logical and ordered way of thinking. Takes on way too many projects at a time. Diplomacy is a strong suit; has the ability to say what others want to hear, tells things straight without offending and can disagree without being disagreeable.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;strong>My 'O's:&lt;/strong> Is highly opinionated and will be candid and direct when exrpressing opinions. Will give straight opinion when asked for it.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;strong>The stems on my 'D's and 'T's:&lt;/strong> Demands respect and will expect others to treat her with honor and dignity.

Is an introvert who makes decisions based on logic, therefore is rarely impulsive. Doesn't find any need for expressing emotions and sees this as an unnecessary waste of time. Many people do not understand and it is difficult for them to really know how she feels. Enjoys being alone, and prefers working alone. Working with her hands is a pleasure. Does feel emotions, as deeply as anyone else, but they're harboured inside. The first time someone angers her, she probably will not say anything to that person. However, she will mentally keep track of everything this person does wrong to her until she cannot hold her emotions inside any longer. Then, Boom! Will never regret telling someone off, because she knew what she was saying the entire time. She won't impulsively tell someone off. Emotional stories will not sway her. Thinks totally with judgment, first considering every situation by the effect it will have on her. Needs space and time alone. &lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;strong>My 'K's:&lt;/strong> Can be defiant. Sometimes has the attitude that if someone doesn't like it the way she is doing it, then they can just \"go to hell!\" This trait may reveal itself in a rebellious nature that is always ready to resist forces which she thinks are infringing upon her freedom of action.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">Are you all believers now?! *shudder* That whole thing was disturbingly accurate. Other than the diplomacy thing of course ;) Go do the test and tell me what your results are!&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;strong>&lt;em>Well, if you're still here after all of the above lol, check back in a little bit, maybe towards the middle of next week for pictures and other scintillating things from my trip to Montreal!&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>"},

It was kitschy five years ago when UO started putting sexually charged slogans on seemingly innocent looking t-shirts, but now it's just getting plain tasteless. Sure FCUK is actually a nifty little acronym for French Connection: UK, and G-Sus isn't supposed to be another way of saying Jesus, it's supposed to mean G suspended as in the guitar chord. But does anyone know what TNA's excuse is? Because i have no idea. At the risk of sounding like a prude i find all of the above and then some really tasteless. Honestly what's the point of walking around with clothes that have the above brandings on them? (I don't even think FCUK clothes are even nice to begin with, but the &lt;a href=\"http://www.burner.de/start/shop.produkte/sxx_filter[reset]/true/sxx_filter[brand]/156\" target=\"_blank\">G-Sus stuff&lt;/a>, i'll admit, it's tempting ;) But not tempting enough!) It's not ironic! If anything it's borderline offensive, just like the Parasuco lesbian tag-team billboards. Just recently there was a bit of a brouhaha over someone wanting to use the acronym \"WTF?\" as a stand in for \"Where's The Faith?\" In my opinion that completely dilutes the point of the message. It's just as offensive as the &lt;a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3790315.stm\" target=\"_blank\">underwear and bikini bottoms that Harrods was selling this summer&lt;/a>. The ones with the hindu goddesses on them. Another example of pure tastelessness and lack of decorum. Yeah i'll shut up and have my high tea now. Everyone's entitled to be a bit prudish sometimes!&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;strong>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">On a lighter note. Or perhaps a heavier one?&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/strong>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">After coming back from the motherland Ammi has re-acquainted herself with some old friends and there has been a flurry of e-mails going back and forth between them. They're all hardcore artsies with a propensity for drama. Most of them (when we were still in Sri Lanka) were really fond of Aiya due to his rampant ADD and bouts of dyslexia; they haven't seen him in many years, so Ammi decided to send them some pictures! Of course she picked the MOST unflattering picture of the two us from my 20th birthday soiree and promptly proceeded to e-mail them half way across the world. Everyone responded in the same manner, \"Oh Eraj (Aiya) looks just like Eksath (Thathi)!\" and everyone ignored the other half of the picture. Me. Then along came Richard Simon who said \"Eraj still looks just like Eksath and D still looks just like you (only a little bit plumper.)\" Only a little bit PLUMPER? What the heck is that?! Come on Richard, if you're going to say someone's fat, then be a little bit more eloquent! You are a professional writer after all. &lt;a href=\"http://www.infolanka.com/discover/bevis/\" target=\"_blank\">Here is a sample of Richard's greatness.&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">Speaking of people being fat, has anyone caught the new George Stroumboulopoulos show on CBC Newsworld?  &lt;em>The Hour&lt;/em>?  Anyone else noticed how much weight he's lost?!  And a little tip to his make-up artist, go easy on the blush, the rosy cheeked thing doesn't really fly well on him.  I'm a little bit disappointed about the show i must say, and i consider myself a fan!  He was really the only redeeming thing about MuchMusic but the CBC's trying too hard to market his show as \"edgey\" and in your face, but poor Georgie's left looking like a try hard.  He &lt;em>is&lt;/em> edgey, and in your face; now he just comes across as unnatural.  Sadly that's what happens on the CBC don't you think?  They try sooo hard to market a person as being a certain way that they end up making caricatures of them.  For example &lt;em>This Hour Has 22 Minutes&lt;/em> and &lt;em>The Royal Canadian Airfarce&lt;/em>, they'd have you believe that these shows are side splittingly funny.  They have their moments, but by and large it's cheese.  I guess that's marketing for you, but if that's the case then the CBC should get a new marketing company, our move out of doing it in-house!&lt;/span>"},

I'm a 33 yr. old man, divorced for 4 years with 2 daughters ages 12 and 6 and i'm going to attempt to chronicle my life as a single man to shed a little bit of insight to my newly found life as an extremely sexy, single guy. The first thing that you have to learn as a single guy is how to deal with alcoholism.. not really the destructive stumbling falling down drunkeness, but the daily drinking that seems to come naturally with being a single male.  you see, after spending your day at work, you come home to an empty house on the nights that you don't have your kids around and you have two choices..either make yourself dinner which causes dirty dishes and trash, or go to the bar and get a sandwich and a beer.. well, obviously the latter choice results in becoming a much better pool player and obtaining your very own beer gut.. these things i've found are much easier to get than a decent woman but not nearly as pleasurable... so after a couple years of experimenting with this behavior you decide on an alternative, which for me included joining a gym and making deals with yourself to get along without ending up looking like that guy down the street that you can't for the life of you understand what his motivation to live is. (see the complete and runon sentence thing is already a problem) so you make a pact with yourself to not drink monday thru thursday and make it to the gym every morning at 5:30 a.m. to get your workout in before work, eat right, work on basketball, boxing, and golf skills at lunch time, and generally be the guy that every married woman on the planet would rather have than their husband, and still be able to not get one single (single) woman interested in you. so here's were we're at in my first blogamadiggy.. i have great days because i'm physically fit, controlled my demons, enjoy my time with my children, and can do virtually anything that i want to do.. and at the same time have no good outlook on ever having a positive relationship because of the comfort level that i've found within myself.  so now the real story starts, how does a man find a woman he can have a relationship with when he has made himself so independant and in all reality the perfect man? well, the answer of course is that he can't so that's why these weblogs will continue for quite some time and i plan to log my dating experiences, both horrible and notsohorrible for your reading pleasure.  the first thing i had to deal with is the fact that even at 33 years of age i had never asked a girl out face to face.. this is a serious problem for someone like me, i was fixed up with my wife through a friend, and fixed up with my last serious girlfriend through my ex-wife so i've really never been single or had to ever ask a female out before.. so i needed some guidance, that's where the internet comes in handy.. you see, there is no need for things like eye contact, nice cloths, good breath to chat with strangers on the internet.. where in real life this can be both challenging and terrifying, online you have the ability to treat everyone like the girl on the playground you used to torment. so that's how i get my start in this whole singles thing and thanks to aol groups, you can simultaniously e-mail everyone in a group with one stupid comment like \"why is it so damn funny when you see someone slip on ice and fall flat on their ass?\" well, needless to say, this comment caused several reactions with our more sensitive of the female gender, and i got called all sorts of unapropriate things.. but it also gave me a chance to privately e-mail all of these ladies back and looking back i actually made a friend out of the deal (and got some much needed casual sex from another).. i've lost my train of thought and must go play mindless computer games now, this blog will continue as long as i'm single so sign up for your 4 year subscription now while quantities last! ..peace. d"},

I have been struggling with Lust. I thought I would look it up in my Thompson Chain Reference Bible (topic 667) and here are the verses they listed (all of these are from the King James Version--not copyrighted).&lt;br />&lt;br />Proverbs 6:25 &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. &lt;/span>This is interesting, because Solomon says there is a two-way relationship: we lust, and she takes. This gives us two opportunities to stop the cycle.&lt;br />&lt;br />Matthew 5:28 &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.&lt;/span> And we thought we were better because we didn't actually DO something, just thought or saw it.&lt;br />&lt;br />Romans 13:4 &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.&lt;/span> Not pretty to hear, but eventually we could be judged for our wrongs.&lt;br />&lt;br />Galatians 5:16 &lt;span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. &lt;/span>A solution, keep reading the Bible and praying and stay in the Spirit and we can conquer sin. It has been conquered for us if we simply claim the victory in Jesus.&lt;br />&lt;br />Colossians 3:5 &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:&lt;/span>&lt;br />concupiscence (def) A strong desire, especially sexual desire; lust.  Mortify means put to death, if I am correct.  Do not even give it a CHANCE to live, or continue.&lt;br />&lt;br />1 Thessalonians 4:5 &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />2 Timothy 2:22 &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&lt;/span>  Keep good company.&lt;br />&lt;br />James 1:15 &lt;span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.&lt;/span>  The pleasure of sin is temporary, and it puts you in a downward spiral towards death.  Maybe not &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic;\">always &lt;/span>Physical death but definitely a spiritual death.  It leaves us alienated from the Father, unable to hear His voice.  Of course, in this day and age, physical death can be associated with lust.&lt;br />&lt;br />1 Peter 2:11 &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;&lt;/span>  He is calling them \"beloved\" even though they may be involved with fleshly lusts.  This shows the love of God for even \"strangers and pilgrims.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />Out of nine verses, one talks about judgement, and another one about the consequences of sin and lust.  This tells me how loving God is, that in this area where we struggle there is instruction and encouragement, rather than death and destruction.  Which is what we like to say to others, but never want it to apply to ourselves."},

Saturday turning out alright if I can remember it at all,  Aaron loved the Gyro and we watched Gothica and mary-Kate and Ashley host SNL.  Sunday I don't recall,  Monday was bowling but we didn't go, we stood around, went downtown(I got a ticket) and then to Rat's house.  Tuesday was lame-o, I skipped and hurt my finger.  I saw Sarah's soccer game and they won then I went to Robyn's house and helped her write a story (yay).  Wednesday I hungout with my lover and we drove around and came here and went to his house, I dunno it was good though.  Thursday I had work until like 7 and then I had to do my psychology report which took like 4 hours.  Friday was a fun day evena t school, then we went to Saulapalooza and heard all the guys play.  L*Mo was a fun time.  They lied about playing threa-gay fags.  That songs annoying anyway.  After Saul's Aaron and I made yummy oatmeal squares for Nick because it was his 15th Birthday!!!  Then we went to his house and cleaned up while listening to the beatles-goods.  Then Once the ride/car situation was all good we had a good time.  They had tons of alcohol and weed but all I had was one berry weis, it was still really fun though.  I was able to drive the guiys to wal-greens in Jim's sweet ass car, so that was cool.  It was kinda wierd when Aaron's parents came home though, I just hungout by them for awhile.  Led Zeppelin was NICE to listen to, so was the Sabbath, and the Beatles, oh it was a good music night.  Ah well.  Joe was nice enough to take me home this morning so I could be ready for work, which I now am so.  I'm gonna get a moooove on.   Peace "},

Todos sabem que, a princ\u00edpio, esse seria pr\u00e1 ser um di\u00e1rio... Um confidente... E, ele acabou se tornando um amigo nas horas mais dif\u00edceis enquanto eu estava apaixonada e passando por maus bocados por n\u00e3o ser correspondida... Escutando meus lamentos, dividindo minhas felicidades, me dando o ombro pr\u00e1 chorar...&lt;br />&lt;br />Estava triste, estava magoada... E decidi que n\u00e3o escreveria mais enquanto estivesse assim... N\u00e3o queria (e nem quero) a pena de ningu\u00e9m... S\u00f3 quero ser forte e voltar a ter aquela for\u00e7a que eu tinha h\u00e1 algum tempo... Uma for\u00e7a que me permitia ag\u00fcentar o mundo nas costas... Uma for\u00e7a que me deixava invulner\u00e1vel a toda forma de amor. Por isso, resolvi deixar o tempo passar...&lt;br />&lt;br />E o tempo passou...&lt;br />&lt;br />Dizem que o tempo \u00e9 o grande mestre que cura todas as feridas...&lt;br />&lt;br />A verdade \u00e9 que ele n\u00e3o cura!&lt;br />&lt;br />A verdade \u00e9 que, quando amamos de verdade uma pessoa, esse sentimento vai nos acompanhar por toda a vida... A \u00fanica coisa que o tempo nos permite fazer \u00e9 varrer esse sentimento pr\u00e1 um cantinho escondido bem no fundo de nossas almas para que, pelo menos \u00e0s vezes, possamos fazer de conta que ele n\u00e3o est\u00e1 l\u00e1 e, mesmo assim, quando vemos uma imagem ou escutamos uma m\u00fasica ou nos aproximamos de datas especiais, esse sentimento volta \u00e0 tona nos pegando de surpresa e nos arrastando pro fundo do po\u00e7o mais uma vez.&lt;br />&lt;br />Isso aconteceu de novo na p\u00e1scoa... Tantos planos... Tanta coisa boa planejada... Tanta coisa boa sonhada... Mas eu estava longe... E meu amor, vivendo uma nova paix\u00e3o.&lt;br />&lt;br />E, novamente, decidi que era hora de deixar o tempo passar...&lt;br />&lt;br />E o tempo, novamente passou...&lt;br />&lt;br />O mundo n\u00e3o parou para que eu pudesse lamber minhas feridas, deix\u00e1-las cicatrizar e olhar orgulhosa para as cicatrizes das batalhas que travei sozinha.&lt;br />&lt;br />Ent\u00e3o pessoas...&lt;br />&lt;br />Venho aqui hoje me despedir desse blog... Venho aqui trazendo meu amor nas m\u00e3os, como se fosse um passarinho e libertando-o, deixando que ele voe e alcance os c\u00e9us e a felicidade que um dia tentei dar... A felicidade que, por muito e muito tempo tentei, desesperadamente participar.&lt;br />&lt;br />Ent\u00e3o \u00e9 isso...&lt;br />&lt;br />F\u00e1... Uma nova e feliz vida pr\u00e1 voc\u00ea...&lt;br />&lt;br />Voc\u00ea sabe que vai ser sempre especial pr\u00e1 mim, n\u00e9?&lt;br />&lt;br />Quando precisar de mim pr\u00e1 qualquer coisa, pode ter certeza que vou estar ao teu lado... N\u00e3o importa a hora nem o dia nem o lugar... Eu vou estar l\u00e1! A partir de hoje, voc\u00ea \u00e9 meu irm\u00e3o querido.&lt;br />&lt;br />E, como n\u00e3o podia deixar de ser... Aqui vai mais uma m\u00fasica... A \u00faltima... A que vai sempre me fazer lembrar de um final de semana em Porto Alegre... A m\u00fasica que, enquanto existir, n\u00e3o vai deixar que eu me esque\u00e7a dos melhores dias da minha vida.&lt;br />&lt;br />Muito obrigada por tudo...&lt;br />&lt;br />Zeina&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;strong>Legi\u00e3o Urbana - \u00cdndios&lt;br />&lt;br />Quem me dera, ao menos uma vez,&lt;br />Ter de volta todo o ouro que entreguei&lt;br />A quem conseguiu me convencer&lt;br />Que era prova de amizade&lt;br />Se algu\u00e9m levasse embora at\u00e9 o que eu n\u00e3o tinha.&lt;br />&lt;br />Quem me dera, ao menos uma vez,&lt;br />Esquecer que acreditei que era por brincadeira&lt;br />Que se cortava sempre um pano-de-ch\u00e3o&lt;br />De linho nobre e pura seda.&lt;br />&lt;br />Quem me dera, ao menos uma vez,&lt;br />Explicar o que ningu\u00e9m consegue entender:&lt;br />Que o que aconteceu ainda est\u00e1 por vir&lt;br />E o futuro n\u00e3o \u00e9 mais como era antigamente.&lt;br />&lt;br />Quem me dera, ao menos uma vez,&lt;br />Provar que quem tem mais do que precisa ter&lt;br />Quase sempre se convence que n\u00e3o tem o bastante&lt;br />E fala demais por n\u00e3o ter nada a dizer.&lt;br />&lt;br />Quem me dera, ao menos uma vez,&lt;br />Que o mais simples fosse visto como o mais importante,&lt;br />Mas nos deram espelhos&lt;br />E vimos um mundo doente.&lt;br />&lt;br />Quem me dera, ao menos uma vez,&lt;br />Entender como um s\u00f3 Deus ao mesmo tempo \u00e9 tr\u00eas&lt;br />E esse mesmo Deus foi morto por voc\u00eas -&lt;br />\u00c9 s\u00f3 maldade ent\u00e3o deixar um Deus t\u00e3o triste.&lt;br />&lt;br />Eu quis o perigo e at\u00e9 sangrei sozinho.&lt;br />Entenda - assim pude trazer voc\u00ea de volta para mim,&lt;br />Quando descobri que \u00e9 sempre s\u00f3 voc\u00ea&lt;br />Que me entende do in\u00edcio ao fim&lt;br />E \u00e9 s\u00f3 voc\u00ea que tem a cura para o meu v\u00edcio&lt;br />De insistir nessa saudade que eu sinto&lt;br />De tudo que eu ainda n\u00e3o vi.&lt;br />&lt;br />Quem me dera, ao menos uma vez,&lt;br />Acreditar por um instante em tudo que existe&lt;br />E acreditar que o mundo \u00e9 perfeito&lt;br />E que todas as pessoas s\u00e3o felizes.&lt;br />&lt;br />Quem me dera, ao menos uma vez,&lt;br />Fazer com que o mundo saiba que seu nome&lt;br />Est\u00e1 em tudo e mesmo assim&lt;br />Ningu\u00e9m lhe diz ao menos obrigado.&lt;br />&lt;br />Quem me dera, ao menos uma vez,&lt;br />Como a mais bela tribo, dos mais belos \u00edndios,&lt;br />N\u00e3o ser atacado por ser inocente.&lt;br />&lt;br />Eu quis o perigo e at\u00e9 sangrei sozinho.&lt;br />Entenda - assim pude trazer voc\u00ea de volta para mim&lt;br />Quando descobri que \u00e9 sempre s\u00f3 voc\u00ea&lt;br />Que me entende do in\u00edcio ao fim&lt;br />E \u00e9 s\u00f3 voc\u00ea que tem a cura para o meu v\u00edcio&lt;br />De insistir nessa saudade que eu sinto&lt;br />De tudo que eu ainda n\u00e3o vi.&lt;br />&lt;br />Nos deram espelhos e vimos um mundo doente&lt;br />Tentei chorar e n\u00e3o consegui.&lt;/strong>"},

Amazing huh?  I wished i could have gone back to bed, cuz i wasnt feeling the greatest. i think it had something to do with that red capsule my friend slipped in my soda last night.  Nah, just kidding. But i &lt;em>DO&lt;/em> think it had to do with some kinda \"non-alcoholic\" drink my friend gave me last night.  (thats the truth)  Good thing Im never plannin on drinkin the real stuff. I wouldnt be able to handle it very well i have a feeling. But newho, I got a quick shower (which prolly is equal to 3 or 4 averagely-timed showers)for me, and then i headed off to my church. My dad let me drive. I only have my permit.  and a good thing too, cuz you prolly wouldnt want me to be reigning the roads at the same time as yourself.  im perty bad at the skill so far.  I forgot to signal all of my turns on the drive over to the church and i was in la-la land. Couldnt even park straight.  But i made it there safely.  Then i headed off with my youth group to our church camp for \"Mud Day\".  I bet you'll never guess wut we all did--oh shoot. Youre smart. Yea, thats right; we played in the mud.  The ppls had filled a dirt pit with water and then we all hopped on in. It was a bit chilly, but hey, its not every day one is allowed to flop around in some fresh mud. So I hardly minded the temperature.  After we rinsed off, we headed back home. I listened to \"Barlow Girls\" the entire ride back.  Then i got a shower.  Now im sittin here.  Crazy, huh?  Alright, i feel like crap. And im tired if typing. Besides, who would wanna talk to &lt;em>&lt;strong>you&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> anways?  im outtie. peace."},

I think mostly, because I have a bunch of things I want to talk about. I sort of like the idea of writing a tiny journal entry like how Papa did, about things he'd been thinking about. I miss Daddy very, very much right now. I sort of want to send him an e-mail, too.&lt;br />&lt;br />I think that it's rather neat, how Daddy's and my schedules work right now. Especially Wednesdays, I think that it's neat that Papa has Wednesday off, to be with Ojii-sama, on the day that I have class almost all day long. I think that it works super well that way, and is really convenient for both of us.&lt;br />&lt;br />I feel very amused, because I just tried the \"grapples\" that I picked out at the store. They were a bit disappointing, though. They smelled super much like grapes, but only tasted a little bit like them, and more like apples instead. I didn't like them particularly much, since I don't like grape very much, but it was super, super interesting to get to try them anyway. I wonder if there is a website about them, too.&lt;br />&lt;br />I still feel very much overwhelmed about Ragnarok Online. I like the idea of playing it with Daddy very, very much, though. I think that it will be really fun to get to be Papa's little acolyte. I hope super much, that we won't spend all of our time together playing it, though. I still want to be able to spend time with Papa on AIM, just chatting and snuggling and doing other fun things, and not just playing RO with him.&lt;br />&lt;br />I really didn't like the argument Papa and I had about it, and Kristi today. I really do dislike the idea of having Kristi know very much about me. I think that one of the reasons I dislike the idea so much, is because of some of the comments she's made about BDSM before. She didn't want Ellie to be named Electra, because she thought that it sounded like a name a dominatrix would have. She also got very upset when one of her friends called her that, before too.&lt;br />&lt;br />I feel really odd about the idea of being a little boy for Papa right now. I feel sort of like I've lost the ability to be a little boy for him anymore, really. I like the idea of it still, though. It really helped that Daddy let me be a little boy with him when I got so upset today. Daddy is right, that being a little boy makes it a whole bunch easier to deal with scary or upsetting things. I want to be a little boy for him more often, though. I want to play games with my Daddy, and to do colorings for him.&lt;br />&lt;br />Class today was a bit more interesting than usual, in that we talked a bit about what the different parts of an argument were, and how to tell if something said was just repeating another point the person made. I really like the idea of picking apart the arguments people make.&lt;br />&lt;br />It was very odd when I needed to go to the bathroom during the break we were given tonight, though. I had to wait, which I think is horribly embarrassing and annoying; a middle aged woman came in after me, and then opened the door back up to check the sign on it. I thought that it was so, so funny that she did that. I wanted to laugh very much, but I think that it's good that I didn't.&lt;br />&lt;br />I've really, really liked that Daddy and I have been more sexual lately. I really love being called Papa's little bitch, whore and slut. I like feeling embarrassed, and blushing so, so brightly. I like how it feels when I blush bright red, usually. I really like thinking about Papa dressing me up in revealing outfits, and having me do embarrassing things for him. I liked it very much, when Daddy called me his little \"kitten slut\" in the scene we started a bit ago. I love being so, so submissive to Papa sexually so much."},

I always had doubts about everything in my life, there was always that hidden voice that whispered in my head. I woke up this morning feeling different, feeling focused, and having the drive to take on anything that stepped in my path. In all of my life I have never been 100% sure of what I wanted. I have always second guessed my own decisions. I know without a doubt what I want from my life and I will start working towards getting it, reguardless of how hard that may be. Today is the begining of my new life, and the end of my old excuses. I will accept responsibility for my actions, and the reactions that were caused by them. Today I will move forward, today I will finally grow up, and today I will start working towards my goals and insisting that I achieve them. I will accept my mistakes, forgive myself, and learn from them to better myself. They say \"that which does not kill you only makes you stronger\" and it took the worst experience of my life to finally open my eyes to the fact that \"I really dont like myself\". That changes starting today....  "},

I have been beating myself up trying to figure out what I could have done wrong. The whole time sitting here asking myself how she could do this to us if our relationship ever had any meaning to her. I was so busy insisting that I knew best and that everything would be fine if she would just give us another chance. All this time asking how she could do this to us, never realizing she honestly was doing it for us. With one look into her eyes..all of her pain, all of her love, all of her feeling poured out onto me like a faucet. I was convinced that she had given up on us, but that wasnt the case at all. When she hugged me I felt it, the feelings for me that I thought she was trying to through away, all still there. She has been telling me all along that she wasnt turning her back on us, that she wasnt writing us off, that she just needed time to make things right in her head about us. I just couldnt walk away from her, I just couldnt give her what she needed. All of the doubts that filled my mind, all of the time I spent trying to convince myself that she just didnt care anymore, all of the false reasons that I came up with in my own paranoid delusion fell completely flat when I saw the struggle she was going through in her eyes just by seeing me. I have never felt like more of an ass than I did today, I never realized how bad all of this was hurting her, or how hard she was fighting to make it right, and now that I finally do, I have done so much damage on top of the initial problem that I dont know if it can ever be repaired. So now, not only do I get to spend the rest of my life knowing that I lost the greatest thing that has ever touched my life, but I also get to spend that time, knowing that I may never have it back, and without any doubt in my mind, that there is no one to blame but myself. I dont know how she could forgive me, hell, I dont know how I can forgive me. All I can do is say that I fucked up, and Im sorry that I couldnt just listen, all that I needed to know to make things better was right there, and I never saw it. I was so afraid that I was going to lose you that I couldnt open my eyes to what was really going on. I have always been able to handle tuff situations quite well, but unfortunately when it mattered most, my heart wouldnt let me do what my head knew was best, and as a result..  I will probably never know how the dreams we always had of our life together will end. Im on a roll...what can I fuck up next... *sighs*"},

I only hope that she meant the things she said all this time..and that the things that made us so happy together are the same things that bring her back. If anything that she told me in the last 2 and a half years was true, she will be back... its fitting that the same woman that showed me the most incredible love.. the kind you only read about.. is the same woman that showed me the most horrible pain that i could possibly imagine.. the thing that i have feared the most in my life.. having to live it without her...

As I made my turn north, I noticed a car facing south, and the woman in the driver seat was sticking her middle finger up at me. She was looking right at me, and I lipread her yelling A#*hole.  I made my turn, and parked on the side of the road (because we don't have an employee parking lot...)and thought, 'huh, what a psycho.' It dawned on me about a block into my walk to work (I had to park 3.5 blocks away because the city street cleaning is today and tomorrow, so there is no parking on the street where I work) that I didn't have my turn signal on. That's why she freaked out. But, in my defense I was all the way over to the farthest side of the street (where cars park) and approached the corner where I turned slowly. So, it's not like I did a Speedracer maneuver and cut her off at the last minute. What a psycho. When I was only a half a block away I remembered something I left in my car that I needed. So I had to turn back around and retrieve it. I was only a few feet from my car when suddenly a car stopped (screeching it's tires) and a woman's voice shouted out, \"It's people like you that kill innocent people! You're an ignorant person, and a horrible driver!!!\", and then she sped off. Did she double back just to say that to me? I stood dumbfounded, bewildered even. I had no choice but to shrug it off, what was I going to do? Start shouting back at no one? I got the thing I forgot out of my car, and made way back to work. A homeless man greeted me at the corner and asked me for a smoke, and when I said don't got it, he asked me for a dollar. I told him I had nothing, and he called me a crazy slut. I was about 1 block away from work, and I saw James Brown, aka \"The Beast\" (you know from my previous post, this is my co-worker who wears James Brown style wigs, and I LOATHE HER.) &lt;br />So I see James Brown, and I thought to myself, \"This is a perfect way to top off a crappy start.\" I looked over to her and smiled politely. She started to yell something over to me. \"What's that?\"  I said, as I could barely hear her. \"I say-ed, you best not be parked in the parking lot! Someone took my spot!\" (time-out, she technically doesn't have one of the coveted reserved spots in our tiny agency van only parking lot, she took one and bullies everyone into letting her keep it.) &lt;br />\"No...\" I started to say, and the most miraculous thing happened. She started marching towards me, and walked right through the biggest pile of dog crap ever, in sandals even. Oh it was beautiful, first the disgusting act, then the horrified reaction, then me walking away smiling for the first time today. &lt;br />She shouted something out to me, but I couldn't really make it out, and I didn't care to. Sometimes you just gotta let it go..."},

The clients we serve are often coming from a pretty dark place, and are struggling to find their purpose while getting over traumatic experiences. We are not a Christian organization or an organization that has anything to do with religion, but ironically we're heavily funded by Jewish organizations. However, we do have Christian staffers who offer words of Holy kindness when in doubt. We once had a staffer that would say to the clients, \"you need Jesus\" whenever the client was acting out their aggression towards the counselors. The other day, I was walking through the hallway, and one of the younger clients called out to me for help. I stopped back to her doorway to find her stuggling with a messy mop of hair. She explained to me that she couldn't get it &lt;br />(her hair) to lie flat, and that she was doomed to be ugly. I went to her assistance combing it this way and that, trying to find a part that would work. After about 10 minutes of my struggling to get control of the situation the client broke the frustration by sighing loudly and saying, \"Maggie, it's no use. My hair needs Jesus.\" Just when you think they never listen...&lt;br />&lt;br />Well, 4 more days until the election. I really can't wait for it all to be over. Personally, I don't stand strong behind either candidate. I'm quite angry with the Democratic Party for endorsing Kerry as their candidate. I was in favor of a few other options. Oh well, too late to bitch now. All we can do is sit back and hope either way, it doesn't get worse. At this point we are waist deep in a pile of crap, and I have a good feeling that under either man's watch we'll sink up to our necks before we shovel our way out. Anyone who has traveled overseas in the past four years (especially post-Iraqi invasion) knows the lowly viewpoint the rest of the world has of us. We look more greedy and more wasteful then ever. But we're safer, safer, safer. If we are so safe, why do we need to be reminded all the time?&lt;br />I think from this point on until November 2nd, I will study my voter's guide (so many proposals in California) and try to figure out how to vote for what. My bid on the next President is already spoken for, unfortunately I'm not happy about it."},

She gets the index and there's Master Chief riding off to Earth in that Covenant battleship, and it ends?  IT ENDS?  What is the point of making a second one (story line wise) that has the same plot as its first?  You have to stop the Covenant from activating Halo like in the first Halo, so what's the point of making a second game (again story line wise) if it ends nowhere advancing the story line.  He's no more closer to the end. &lt;br />If you stay to watch the end of the credits, there was a cut scene that showed that weird ass monster of that planet talk to CORTANA BECAUSE MASTER CHIEF LEFT HER THERE!  Who is stupid enogh to leave the Artificial Intelligence of a UNSCC  Naval Battleship on an alien planet?  Don't you think that there might be a chance that they may want to copy your weapon's developement or shield regenerators (though I don't think it matters, because if you notice how good that \"mohawk\" guy's works).

I do believe that John Waverly did perform unethically. As a CEO he should be more professional and not involve his personal prefaces into his work life. Since John is a married man, his motive portrays to be even more unethical. The sexual harassment in this case occurred when the postgraduate was not offered a job. John focused on his attraction to her rather that on a job opportunity. The postgraduate had every right to believe that this was a sexual harassment issue and the proper board members needed to be notified. If a physical relationship had already developed prior to the confrontation, then I feel that it would not be a sexual harassment case. In this situation there was no physical relationship, just a strong work friendly partnership. John violated the Code Of Ethics and he has to face the consequences. Overall, sexual harassment is a major violation and can come in different forms. These forms include physical, verbal, and emotional. John's verbal discussion of his attraction to the postgraduate, to me falls in to the category of sexual harassment. "},

Sorry I was so spastic, I didn't even think to ask how your sister's team did.  It was the end of a very long week and a stressful morning.

The Western Roman Empire was in ruins and the Eastern Empire was based in Constantinople and trying desperately to keep the power of its early grandeur while transitioning to Christianity as a de facto state religion. The costs to the average person were unbearable as he was being required to meet the constantly rising taxes levied from the state along with the tithes coerced by the Church. What Islam offered was the &amp;#8220;carrot or the sword&amp;#8221;.&lt;br />&lt;br />If you became a convert, your taxes were immediately eliminated, as was your tithe. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t, you faced death. The choice was not hard for most to make, unless you were a very devoted martyr in the making. At the beginning, even the theology was not too hard for most to swallow, considering that both Judaism and Christianity were given their due by the Prophet. There is but one God-Allah, and Muhammad is His Prophet, as was Jesus, and the pre-Christian Jewish prophets of the Torah (old testament). Both were called &amp;#8220;children of the book&amp;#8221;, the book being the Koran, which replaced both the Old and New testaments for Christians and Jews.&lt;br />&lt;br />With this practical approach to spreading the &amp;#8220;word&amp;#8221; Islam grew like wild fire, reaching out from the Saudi Arabian Peninsula in all directions. This early growth is what the Muslims call the &amp;#8220;first&amp;#8221; great Jihad and it met with little resistance until Charles Martel of France, the father of Charlemagne, stopped them in the battle of Tours in France, after they had firmly established the religion on the Iberian peninsula. This first onslaught against the West continued in various forms and at various times until Islam was finally driven out of Spain in 1492 at the battle of Granada. &lt;br />&lt;br />The &amp;#8220;second great jihad&amp;#8221; came with the Ottoman Turks. This empire succeeded in bringing about the downfall of Constantinople as a Christian stronghold and an end to Roman hegemony in all of its forms. The Ottoman Empire was Islam&amp;rsquo;s most successful expansion of territory even though the religion itself had fractured into warring sects and bitter rivalries with each claiming the ultimate truths in &amp;#8220;the ways of the Prophet&amp;#8221;. By 1683 the Ottomans had suffered a series of defeats on both land and sea and the final and failed attempt to capture Vienna set the stage for the collapse of any further territorial ambitions and Islam shrunk into various sheikhdoms, emir dominated principalities, and roving tribes of nomads. However, by this time a growing anti-western sentiment, blaming its internal failures on anyone but themselves, was taking hold and setting the stage for a new revival know has Wahhabism which came into full bloom under the House of Saud on the Arabian peninsula shortly before the onset of WWI. It is this Wahhabi version of Islam which has infected the religion itself, now finding adherents in almost all branches and sects, especially the Shiites. What this sect calls for is the complete and total rejection of anything and everything which is not based in the original teachings of The Prophet and it finds its most glaring practice in the policies of the Afgani Taliban or the Shiite practices of the late Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran. Its Ali Pasha (Field Marshall) is now known as Osama bin Laden, the leader of the &amp;#8220;third Jihad&amp;#8221;.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Jimmy Carter sets the stage&lt;br />&lt;/b>&lt;br />The strategy for this &amp;#8220;holy war&amp;#8221; did not begin with the planning of the destruction of the World Trade Center. It began with the plans for toppling the Shah of Iran back in the early 1970&amp;rsquo;s and culminated with his exile in 1979. With his plans and programs to &amp;#8220;westernize&amp;#8221; his country, along with his close ties to the U.S. and subdued acceptance of the State of Israel, the Shah was the soft target.&lt;br />&lt;br />Thanks, in large part to the hypocritical and disastrous policies of the Jimmy Carter State Department the revolution was set into motion, the Shah was deposed, his arm forces scattered or murdered and stage one was complete. The Third Jihad now had a base of operations and the oil wealth to support its grand design or what they call the &amp;#8220;Great Caliphate&amp;#8221;.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>The Great Caliphate&lt;br />&lt;/b>&lt;br />What this design calls for is the replacement of all secular leadership in any country with Muslim majorities. This would include, Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan, Indonesia, all the Emirates, Sudan, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and finally what they call the &amp;#8220;occupied territory&amp;#8221; Israel.&lt;br />&lt;br />As a part of this strategy, forces of the jihad will infiltrate governments and the military as a prelude to taking control, once the secular leadership is ousted or assassinated. Such was the case in Lebanon leading to the Syrian occupation and what was attempted in Egypt with the murder of Anwar Sadat, along with the multiple attempts on the lives of Hussein in Jordan, Mubarak of Egypt and Musharraf in Pakistan. Pakistan is a particular prize because of its nuclear weapons.&lt;br />&lt;br />The long-range strategy of the Third Jihad counts on three strategic goals. 1. The U.S. withdrawing from the region just as it did in Southeast Asia, following Vietnam. 2. Taking control of the oil wealth in the Muslim countries, which would be upwards to 75% of known reserves, and 3. Using nuclear weapons or other WMDs to annihilate Israel. A further outcome of successfully achieving these objectives would be to place the United Nations as the sole arbiter in East/West negotiations.&lt;br />&lt;br />Evidence of the Bush Administration awareness of this plan is found in the facts that immediately following the 9/11 attack, their first move was to shore up Pakistan and Egypt, believing that these two would be the next targets for al Qaeda while Americans focused on the disaster in New York. The administration also knew that the most important objective was to send a loud and clear message that the U.S. was in the region to stay, not only to shore up our allies but to send a message to the Jihadists. The attack on Afghanistan was necessary to break-up a secure al Qaeda base of operations and put their leadership on the run or in prison. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Why Iraq?&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/b>The war on Iraq also met a very strategic necessity in that no one knew how much collaboration existed between Saddam Hussein and the master planners of the Third Jihad or his willingness to hand off WMDs to terrorist groups including the PLO in Israel. What was known, were serious indications of on-going collaboration, as Saddam funneled money to families of suicide bombers attacking the Israelis and others in Kuwait.&lt;br />&lt;br />What the U.S. needed to establish was a significant base of operations smack dab in the middle of the Islamic world, in a location which effectively cut it in half. Iraq was the ideal target for this and a host of other strategic reasons.&lt;br />&lt;br />Leadership of various anti-American groups both here and abroad understood the vital nature of the Bush initiative and thus launched their demonstrations, world-wide, to &amp;#8220;Stop The War&amp;#8221;. Failing this, they also laid plans to build a political campaign inside the country, with the War in Iraq as a plebiscite, using a little know politician as the thrust point; Howard Dean. This helps to explain how quickly the Radical Left moved into the Dean campaign with both people and money, creating what the clueless media called the &amp;#8220;Dean Phenomenon&amp;#8221;. &lt;br />&lt;br />By building on the left-wing base in the Democrat party and the &amp;#8220;Hate Bush&amp;#8221; liberals, the campaign has already resulted in a consensus among the aspirants, minus Joe Lieberman, to withdraw the U.S. from Iraq and turn the operation over to the U.N. And, if past is prologue, i.e. Vietnam, once the U.S. leaves it will not go back under any circumstances, possibly even the destruction of Israel.&lt;br />&lt;br />Should George W. Bush be defeated in November and a new administration come to power we could expect to see the dominoes start to fall in the secular Islamic countries and The Clash of Civilizations would then become a life changing event in all of our lives.&lt;br />&lt;br />What surprised the Jihadists following the 9/11 attack was how American sentiment mobilized around the president and a profound sense of patriotism spread across the country They were not expecting this reaction, based on what had happened in the past, nor were they expecting the determined resolve of the President himself. I believe that this is one of the reasons we have not had any further attacks within our borders. They are content to wait, just as one of their tactical mentors, V.I. Lenin admonished&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;two steps forward, one step back&amp;#8221;.&lt;br />&lt;br />A couple of additional events serve as valuable footnotes to the current circumstances we face: the destruction of the human assets factor of the CIA during the Carter presidency, presided over by the late Senator Frank Church and Carter&amp;rsquo;s CIA Director, Admiral Stansfield Turner. This fact has plagued our intelligence agencies right up to this very day with consequences which are now obvious. Jimmy Carter is the one man who must bear the bulk of the responsibility for setting the stage of the Third Jihad. Americans should find little comfort in how the Democrat contenders constantly seek the &amp;#8220;advice and counsel&amp;#8221; of this despicable little hypocrite who now prances around with his Nobel Prize, while attacking President Bush with almost as much venom as his fellow Nobel Laureate, Yassir Arafat.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>We should not expect to see any meaningful cooperation from Western Europe, especially the French.&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Since failing to protect their own interests in Algeria by turning the country over to the first of the Arab terrorists, Amid Ben Bella, the country itself is now occupied by Islamic immigrants totally twenty percent of the population. &lt;br />We are in the battle of our lives which will go on for many years possibly even generations. If we fail to understand what we are facing or falter in the challenge of &amp;#8220;knowing our enemy&amp;#8221; the results will be catastrophic. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>PART II (May 1, 2004) &lt;br />&lt;/b>&lt;br />Since writing the above, we have witnessed some frightening evidence in support of our hypothesis both internally and in other parts of the world.&lt;br />&lt;br />The al Qaeda bombing in Madrid has emboldened our enemy into believing it can use terror as an instrument for democratic regime change. Based on what happened there, they may be right.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Kerry and bin Laden on the same page&lt;/b> &lt;br />&lt;br />John Kerry and other leaders of his party constantly refer to the United States as &amp;#8220;acting unilaterally.&amp;#8221; They give no credit whatsoever to countries like Great Britain, Poland, Italy, Australia or even tiny Honduras for putting their limited armed forces in harm&amp;rsquo;s way to support the U.S. led coalition in Iraq. It is little wonder that some are considering doing what Spain has done&amp;#8212;pulling out. The leaders in these countries have spent considerable political capital in this effort, and have little to show for it as it relates to fostering good will with the American public. Couple that fact with Osama bin Ladin&amp;rsquo;s latest offer of withholding attacks on those who &amp;#8220;quit&amp;#8221; the coalition and you have all the elements for a Democrat party fostered &amp;#8220;self-fulfilling prophecy&amp;#8221; where the U.S. will be totally alone in the pacification of Iraq. John Kerry and the Bush critics persist in the &amp;#8220;lie&amp;#8221; of the U.S. going it &amp;#8220;alone&amp;#8221; in Iraq but Osama bin Laden knows differently and will use the Kerry rhetoric to help isolate the U.S. The terrorists now see themselves as political &amp;#8220;king-makers&amp;#8221;. They may be right.&lt;br />&lt;br />Another aspect of the &amp;#8220;anti-Bush&amp;#8221; political axis is how both his political enemies and the main stream media take ghoulish delight in &amp;#8220;the body count,&amp;#8221; just as they did in the later days of Vietnam. Oh sure, they pay incidental homage to the memory of the young Americans who gave their lives in the greatest threat this country has ever faced, but they do so with all the sincerity of Madonna making a vow of chastity. As the body bags grow in number, they believe, so grows their political prospects. They may be right.&lt;br />&lt;br />If the Bush administration is further weakened in the months leading up to the November elections, we will witness a heightened al Qaeda offensive in all parts of the world, including our own country, and especially in Iraq and nations surrounding it ,i.e., Pakistan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Events within the past few days in Jordan not only make this argument but also point to the possibility of &amp;#8220;what happened to the WMDs.&amp;#8221;&lt;br />Iran and Syria are daily growing more overt and bold in their support of insurgents within Iraq, believing that Bush has been so hurt by internal politics that he is powerless to act against them in any meaningful way. They may be right.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>The Leftwing initiative, Political Correctness and Our Will to Win&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Within our own country we are witnessing and almost insane application of &amp;#8220;political correctness.&amp;#8221; As the barbarism of radical Islam grows more apparent in the streets of the Middle East from Gaza to Basra, we see a cultural suicide taking place within our own schools and communities.&lt;br />&lt;br />Our children are being taught from the Koran, our professors are preaching intifadah in their class rooms, and Muslim &amp;#8220;call to prayer&amp;#8221; loud speakers are blaring out from city halls. The more precarious our very existence becomes, the more our liberal brethren embrace their enemies. It is a Stockholm Syndrome which can only lead to the recruitment of young Muslims who will be willing to duplicate in the West what their co-religionists are doing in the streets of Israel and the market places of Baghdad. The liberal P.C. crowd say nothing about the silence of the Muslim religious leadership as it relates to the carnage of innocents but couldn&amp;rsquo;t speak out fast enough against the inspiration supplied to tens of millions of Christians by Mel Gibson&amp;rsquo;s The Passion of the Christ. They were put off by the movie&amp;rsquo;s &amp;#8220;violence&amp;#8221; and its alleged &amp;#8220;fostering of anti-Semitism&amp;#8221;. Movies must represent their &amp;#8220;reality&amp;#8221; as the real thing moves them not at all. Among liberal Jews in America, hatred of George W. Bush is only surpassed by their contempt for Ariel Sharon&amp;#8230;Let them explain it, I am at a total loss to do so. Maybe they just miss seeing Bill Clinton smooching Yassir Arafat in the White House Rose Garden. &lt;br />&lt;br />The &amp;#8220;Reverend&amp;#8221; Jesse Jackson is now calling the U.S. &amp;#8220;guilty of crimes against humanity&amp;#8221; as he sets out to mobilize the non-Islamic Left. None of the Democrat leadership says a word in opposition to Jackson&amp;rsquo;s treason or Hillary&amp;rsquo;s attacks on the President and U.S. policy in an Arabic newspaper, while in London. You can bet that al Jezeera didn&amp;rsquo;t miss a beat in their reporting of both events.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>The campaign takes its toll&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />The campaign is seriously hurting Mr. Bush&amp;rsquo;s leadership role in the War on Terror. While ducking every new book critical of his initiative or trying to counter the partisan nitpicking of the 9/11 Commission, he has persisted in the misbegotten insistence of &amp;#8220;installing democracy&amp;#8221; in Iraq. Our purpose for being in that beleaguered country should be restricted to one purpose and one purpose only, to stop the expansion of The Third Jihad and provide a base for doing same in the neighboring areas. This can be done by sealing the borders, attacking anything that moves in violation of same and by making it clear to Syria and Iran that any participation on their part will be considered an &amp;#8220;act of war&amp;#8221;. Let the country be governed by the local tribes, Shiite in the south, Sunni in the central and Kurds in the north with a U.S. pro consul overseeing the military. Oil revenues could be spilt by population allocation. How about installing a Republic&amp;#8230;it worked pretty well here with diverse populations.&lt;br />&lt;br />The very idea that we should spend our sons and daughters blood or our tax dollars on trying to building a &amp;#8220;democracy&amp;#8221; in the region which has neither a history nor a desire for such, is sheer nonsense. The very essence of Islamic teaching speaks directly against this principle. Continuing on the current path can only result in fostering greater hatred for the &amp;#8220;Great Satan&amp;#8221;. Force is the only thing which is respected in that part of the world and this force need not be tied to &amp;#8220;reform&amp;#8221;. I suggest Mr. Rumsfled acquaint himself with a copy of Julius Caesar&amp;rsquo;s Gallic Wars and Sun Tsu&amp;rsquo;s Art of War. All the tactics and strategies necessary to subdue the Iraqi insurgents can be found in those two military gems.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Please not the UN&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Bringing the U.N. to the party will only compound the problem without adding any accountability. The U.N. has been accused of many things over the years, but being a &amp;#8220;democratic&amp;#8221; institution has never been one of them. Just the latest scandal of the &amp;#8220;Oil for Food&amp;#8221; program should provide any thinking person with all the evidence they need to keep the U.N. at bay. But this doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to bother the likes of the John Kerry&amp;rsquo;s of the world who prattle on as if the scam doesn&amp;rsquo;t even exist.&lt;br />&lt;br />Just one example will make my case; the UN mandate in Israel, which has been in place since 1948. One more salient point needs to be made on this subject. There is no such thing as &amp;#8220;The International Community.&amp;#8221; There are only individual countries, each with its own agenda which is always self serving. The myth of a higher level of &amp;#8220;moral authority&amp;#8221; coming out of the UN as been one of the greater lies of the past half century, but it is a lie which persists in spite of a bloody record of hypocrisy, graft, genocide and &amp;#8220;perpetual war for perpetual peace.&amp;#8221; I have a suggestion for the 9/11 Commission:.Why don&amp;rsquo;t they look into what the UN was doing before the attack on the World Trade Center? If they do, they will find that exactly one week before, the UN was holding a Conference on Racism in Durbin, South Africa where the delegates voted overwhelmingly to condemn Israel, as &amp;#8220;racist and terrorist.&amp;#8221; The U.S., Canadian and Israeli delegates walked out in disgust. Nary a word was uttered about Saddam Hussein, al Qaeda, or the Taliban, to say nothing of what was happening in Rwanda while they crunched caviar on toast and washed it down with vintage Champaign. Genocide does not qualify as &amp;#8220;racism&amp;#8221; according to the UN &amp;#8220;morality.&amp;#8221; Neither we nor the world needs the UN to muck up what is already a very delicate situation. If given proper leadership every Middle Eastern country named above will throw in with the Coalition, for if they don&amp;rsquo;t they will be the next targets of the Third Great Jihad and the Great Caliphate. Pakistan is already showing the leadership which others will follow. What do you think moved Kadahaffi to cozy up to the U.S. and Great Britain? He fears the Jihadist more than he hates us.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Evil Does Exist&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Our current crises, in meeting the threat of the Third Jihad, is one more example of how most Americans simply refuse to believe there is evil in this world and are willing to grant moral equivalence on any human action. Unless the crime is personalized such as in the case of Lacy Peterson, we lose interest quickly and become bored or at least not involved.&lt;br />&lt;br />To try and understand what we are facing, look into the eyes of your son or grandson and try to fathom a mind which would take pride in strapping a bomb to his body and sending him out to kill himself and countless innocent people. Or in the case of your daughter or grand daughter, try to imagine a religion which commands you to mutilate her vagina to destroy her sex drive or demands you to stone her to death if she has sexual relations with a man other than of your choosing.&lt;br />&lt;br />If you can comprehend these facts both intellectually and emotionally, then you will start to understand what we are facing in the months and years ahead, both at home and abroad. &lt;br />&lt;br />The radicals of Islam will stop at nothing to destroy us and all we stand for. They see this war as their &amp;#8220;entry to paradise&amp;#8221; and a release from the miserable existence they have built for themselves within the confines of an evil and perverse religion. The Jihadist are NOT like us, nor most of their fellow Muslims. But, like terrorists everywhere they have silenced any criticisms from fellow Muslims through threat and intimidation and have, with the help of the &amp;lsquo;useful idiots&amp;#8221; in the West, &amp;#8220;created the appearance of popular support&amp;#8221;.&lt;br />&lt;br />If we are incapable of understanding these realities and acting accordingly, within the life time of everyone who reads these words, we will see our cherished way of like cease to exist and chaos become our lot. The Clash of Civilizations is now reaching out and touching all of us. May God grant us the wisdom and the courage to meet the challenge.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div align=\"center\">&lt;b>&lt;a href=\"http://www.patriotsunite.com\" title=\"Patriots Unite\" target=\"_blank\">Patriots Unite&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&lt;/div>"},

This graph from &lt;span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">peakoil.net&lt;/span> shows the discovery data superimposed on to the production data.&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://www.peakoil.net/uhdsg/weo2004/FSU.jpg\" width=\"420\"/>&lt;br />I transcribed the data from the chart (ignoring the extrapolated data) and used the general model source code.&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://img335.imageshack.us/img335/8573/fsuprod1tr.gif\"/>&lt;br />I used a mean value of 5 years for each of the &lt;i>fallow&lt;/i>, &lt;i>build&lt;/i>, and &lt;i>maturation&lt;/i> phases. This came out shorter than the 8 year latencies that I chose for the &lt;a href=\"http://mobjectivist.blogspot.com/2005/10/shock-model-with-aspo-discovery-data.html\">global&lt;/a> and &lt;a href=\"http://mobjectivist.blogspot.com/2005/10/shock-model-applied-to-usa-lower-48.html\">USA-48&lt;/a> model. &lt;br />&lt;br />The green curve assumes a proportional extraction rate of 0.09/year (&lt;i>1/e&lt;/i> time of about 11 years).  This follows the production curve up until about the time of political instability in the Soviet Union. After that point, c.1984, I added perturbations according to the following chart, leading to the red curve which overlays the production data points.&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://img335.imageshack.us/img335/5779/fsuperturb9pw.gif\"/>&lt;br />&lt;a href=\"http://mobjectivist.blogspot.com/2005/10/hubbert-did-in-soviet-union.html\">&lt;/a>&lt;br />The glitch occurring after 1984 looks benign but evidently carried some punch -- according to some interesting remarks I found previously, Reagan had a hand in it:&lt;a href=\"http://mobjectivist.blogspot.com/2005/10/hubbert-did-in-soviet-union.html\">&lt;blockquote>It seems likely that the Reagan administration, which took office in 1981, bearing in mind the economic havoc produced when US production peaked in 1981, followed by the Arab oil embargo and the \"oil crisis\" of 1973-74 and the deep recession that followed, decided to use the \"oil weapon\" to destabilize the USSR. Reagan embarked on a major military buildup, putting the Soviet Union under pressure to keep up. Meanwhile, declining prices after 1981 forced the USSR to pump more oil to supply its clients in Eastern Europe and to sell in world markets for hard currency. Then in 1985 Reagan persuaded Saudi Arabia to flood the world markets with cheap oil. Again, the USSR had to increase output to earn hard currency. This led to the second peak in 1988.&lt;/blockquote>&lt;/a> I see a more of a dip followed by a recovery rather than a strict oil production increase, which I imagine could result from a lagged reaction to market forces. The Soviets had no choice but to shut down their pumps temporarily -- they did not have the technology or reserves to increase production beyond what the big red Soviet machine could already provide. By the time 1988 arrived, it became too late for them to do anything about it, as the eastern bloc started to implode.&lt;br />&lt;br />The post-Soviet transition shows a severe reduction in extraction rates. Clearly, the new FSU republics no longer had to produce oil to continue militarizing their bloc countries and allies (including Cuba). True free-market forces replaced the fixed demand and the new capitalists also had their eye on the green curve (peak oil in 1990). Much like the USA after our peak in 1970, they likely wanted to modulate the supply.&lt;br />&lt;br />So what explains the reverse shock (i.e. sudden extraction increase) in the last few years? Note that the BP data also &lt;a href=\"http://mobjectivist.blogspot.com/2005/10/mind-is-terrible-thing-to-decline.html\">shows this FSU oil production increase&lt;/a>. I don't know why, but OPEC production hasn't really gone up much over the past few years, and the FSU clearly has, or at least had the production capacity during the Soviet era. I would imagine that &lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;\">somebody&lt;/span> has to make up the potentially widening supply &amp; demand gap.  &lt;br />&lt;br />The model shows that at the current proportional extraction rate, the FSU has probably hit its secondary oil peak. They can conceivably try to keep on increasing the extraction rate (seeing as they do have that Soviet-era spare capacity, &lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;\">unless, of course,&lt;/span> it all got sold by Russian scrap-iron merchants in the ensuing years).  But remember, the law of extraction: the steeper the hill, the faster the decline post-peak.&lt;br />&lt;br />Thanks to &lt;a href=\"http://peakenergy.blogspot.com/2005/10/peak-sightings.html#comments\">Big Gav&lt;/a> to get me motivated to work on this analysis.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;hr width=\"70%\"/>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\"I pledge not to go to war for oil\"&lt;/span> -- Jimmy Smits, fictional presidential candidate on the TV show, &lt;span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">West Wing&lt;/span>.&lt;br />&lt;br />Interesting live presentation of the show.&lt;br />&lt;br />Funny how it takes a fictional debate to bring a good discussion of energy issues to the American prime-time audience."},

But over by a clump&lt;br />of bushes near a hill, Hector thought he could see two red pinpoints of light&lt;br />gleaming in the dark space between the vegetation.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;Dad&amp;quot;, he said, &amp;quot;let's go out and wander in the woods!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;No&amp;quot;, Ramon said, &amp;quot;that would be a &lt;b>bad&lt;/b> idea.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;Come on, Dad, I think it would be &lt;i>exciting&lt;/i>.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;You mean it would be dumb.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;Exciting is when something unusual happens to you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;I'll bet you see something unusual in the woods!&amp;quot; said Ramon.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;Only two lousy pinpoints of red light&amp;quot;, said Hector.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;Those are eyes. Monster eyes&amp;quot;, said Ramon.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;Uh ... oh!&amp;quot;, mumbled Hector in a disappointed way.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>Hector went back to his room and thought: 'how can I help Dad?' Then he had&lt;br />an idea. When Ramon was asleep, he would creep out of his room and start the&lt;br />elevator which ran from the bottom of his tree house to the top so that anyone&lt;br />on the forest floor could come up and visit! That would &lt;i>really help&lt;/i> dad.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>Meanwhile, down in the jungle, a horrible monster steadily advanced on&lt;br />Ramon's tree house. It was a great, slimy beast, with two red glowing eyes, a&lt;br />set of razor-sharp fangs and claws plus an insatiable appetite for eating little&lt;br />boys. (It also had cruel talons). But when it got to the base of the mighty&lt;br />tree, on which Ramon's tree house was perched too far above him to reach, he&lt;br />could go no further.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>Just then the light above the elevator on the ground floor was illuminated.&lt;br />The door whisked open and the monster found he could enter the elevator leading&lt;br />to the top floor -- and a meal of little boy.&lt;/p>"},

The leadership (governing board and CEO of paradise Hills) did not see how unethical it was to withhold information from there patients. They had much reason behind the unethical behavior (upkeep of reputation, financial loss, potential law suits), however none was worthy of it. Every healthcare organization will make mistakes; that is not unethical. How the mistake is \u201chandled\u201d can become very unethical. "},

I actually managed to sleep a bit longer this morning. The day before sleep started at 12am, which only gave me 4:30 hours to sleep. Last night I went to sleep at 11pm, which is 5:30 hours of sleep, but still not enough. I need to start going to sleep around 8-9pm. I get off work at 3:00pm, and at that time I usually meet up with a friend of mine who gets off at 3pm for lunch, so we hang out and talk for a bit. Today I am just going to go to home and probably sleep for a bit.&lt;br />&lt;br />I have to concider moving out here pretty soon, because Dell is moving from the downtown core, and it may prove to be difficult to make it to work. Hopefully by the time Dell moves, I will have a raise of my salary and I will be able to manage a bit better with rent and that kind of thing. Its probably going to end up costing me about 1200 in living expenses (rent, food, internets, heat, water) that sort of thing. Although I am pretty sure I can find some rent for very decent price. I don't believe I will be living paycheck to paycheck though, especially if I work everyday and I don't take any time off..&lt;br />&lt;br />I'm starting to wake up now. I guess I just had to be a big groggy this morning, it can't be dodged I am going to feel this way no matter what. Unfortunately I seem to have the bad end of the spectrym. I guess I just need to work out a bit and get my endurance back. Perhaps purchasing a bike isn't such a bad idea for the summer. It wouldn't be so bad. But if it was raining heavily, or snowing like it was yesterday, then I'd probably have to plan ahead and take the bus, and whether I can rely on myself to check on that is another question. I honestly though I was going to give up after the 1st day, but I'm starting to obsorb the material in class, and I am learning it at a good pace. There is a lot to cover in this course, and I can't wait to start this job soon. Only 2 more weeks of training after this and we hit the floor.&lt;br />&lt;br />When the building moves... timing expected to be in July, I'll start to move. That or I'll ask my parents if I can pay rent without any more questions, and they can let me have the basement. I'm willing to pay $500 for room and board which is pretty sweet deal. That would definately look good. That $500 could go a long way for my parents, and help out a lot when it comes to having things like Food and having bills paid for, and ease the tension in the house a whole lot. My income would definately be a great asset. However I don't want to live at home forever, but for now that actually seems quite feasible. I know I don't cost much to maintain, concidering I actually take a good job of taking care of myself... feeding and clothing myself. All I need is a place to sleep that is hopefully warm, and I don't even want to know what it feels like sleep on a bench.&lt;br />&lt;br />But for now this is the way things are. My life seems to be really taking off, and hopefully things will only improve from here on in."},

When my grand father died, I didn't cry, shed a tear, mourn. In fact I forgot about it in less then a week. The pope is like my grand father in the sense, that I never really knew him, never knew what he did or what exactly his impact was on society. I've heard stories about the pope and what he has accomplished, but has any of that directly impacted me? Some say he is the liberator of womans rights. Some say he was the binding of religions and teachings. Did I know him personally? Hardly.&lt;br />&lt;br />Your boss is probably comparible to the pope. Lets think about this for a second. The pope is assumed to have some sort of artificial power, much the same like your boss. Your boss basically tells you what to do all day, like the pope. You are essentially a sheep to the boss and the pope has many flock. You do as the boss says your or fired, or in the case of the pope, you can continue living on a normal life like it didn't matter. This is why I think the pope isn't at all powerful, worthy, or even remotely interesting.&lt;br />&lt;br />Just because someone pushes the button's on CNN to have John Paul 2nd's carcus shown to the rest of the world for a week straight doesn't mean he is super important. Infact, that is a complete waste of air time. Who needs to see someone's dead body? Did you know that during the coverage of the pope's funeral, insurgence in Iraq invaded a prison in Iraq (the one now made famous for being a sexual torture chamber), and killed 15 soldiers? Are the lives of the people you sent to war to 'defend' your country so lack luster that they shouldn't be counted or recongized for there 'sacrifice' that in fact because the pope dies that his life is more important then anyone elses?&lt;br />&lt;br />The problem I have with all this is that we always try and value another person to be better then ourselves or one another. We all know that when the ship is sinking, the only person we are going to care about is ourselves. To assume that the pope would bend over backwords to save your skin in the same instance is flawed, and he probably wouldn't even care about you. The pope was given some of the most robust medical treatment in the world to keep him going this long, especially for 6 more weeks then what most people would of even dreamed of living in there own current state of affairs.&lt;br />&lt;br />We mourn the death of a loved one, thats one thing. But to mourn just for the sake of mourning? Grow up. You may know of someone or met them once or twice, but that doesn't automagically make them a spokesperson for there identity. You leave that to the priest who has to make this stuff up at the funeral. I know when I die, the last thing I want is some person I've only met once in my life start fuming and greaving over my coffin.&lt;br />&lt;br />Terri and the Pope. They are tied together, because we value human life so much. But we turned a blind eye on our soldiers defending a prison camp that made them look like putrid and inhumane members of society. Get over it. No one cares."},

And I haven't even seen the first ad yet.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Actually, I have seen &lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/emayoh/62678035/\">this photo of a billboard&lt;/a> and I just watched the commercial which is available &lt;a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=1448925\">here&lt;/a> from &lt;a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/\">abcnews.com&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />For those of you who don't want to bother to watch it, I'll give you the rundown:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;blockquote>The scene is a wedding reception, winding down, slow song at the end of the night.  You see one young man who is obviously wasted, stumbling around, stumbling up to the stage and banging on the band's drums.  &lt;br />&lt;br />The voiceover says, \"It's easy to tell when you've had way too many.  But what about when you've had one too many?\"  &lt;br />&lt;br />Now you see an apparently sober looking man, drinking a last gulp from his drink before he and his wife head out the door.&lt;br />&lt;br />Finally, the voiceover says, \"Buzzed Driving is Drunk Driving.\"&lt;/blockquote>&lt;br />First, let me start with the personal and get it out of the way.  I don't condone drunk driving, I don't drive drunk.  Throughout college, my friends and I always had a designated driver or just walked home.  Now, I'm lucky to live in an area where I pretty much never drive anywhere, so it's not much of an issue.  But if I go somewhere and I know I'm going to have to drive, say a wedding, I would probably have only one drink, two at the most, depending on how many hours I'm going to be there.  It's fair to say that I err on the side of caution when it comes to drinking and driving.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Now the legal.  The point of this ad campaign, I believe, is to draw the following line of thought:&lt;br />&lt;br />Buzzed Driving = Drunk Driving = Illegal...&lt;br />Therefore, Buzzed Driving = Illegal&lt;br />&lt;br />Which just simply isn't true.  It's a clear misstatement of the law.  In fact, as a defense attorney, when we voir dire in drunk driving cases, one of the things that we want to be sure that every juror understands is that it is not illegal to drink and drive, it is only illegal to drive while legally intoxicated.  &lt;br />&lt;br />So, what is the legal definition of intoxicated?  Simple.  And very objective.  A blood alcohol level above .08 is legally intoxicated.  &lt;br />&lt;br />How drunk is .08?  Well, that's the part that's kind of subjective.  Different people are going to feel and function differently at .08.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.ou.edu/oupd/bac.htm\">This BAC calculator&lt;/a> is kind of fun to play with and gives you an idea of what your BAC.  Even MADD  tells us that:&lt;br />&lt;blockquote>To reach a .08 BAC level, a 170-pound man would have to drink approximately four drinks in one hour on an empty stomach or a 137-pound woman would have to drink approximately three drinks in one hour on an empty stomach.&lt;/blockquote>&lt;br />That's quite a bit.  But, I think the question remains, how do you feel at .08?  Do you feel, \"Whoa, I'm wasted!\" or do you feel, \"Hey, I've got a little buzz on, but I'm good to drive?\"&lt;br />&lt;br />In speaking to experts on the subject (and I mean actual PhDs, not just &lt;a href=\"http://nakeddrinkingcoffee.blogspot.com/2005/12/im-magic.html\">people who drink a lot&lt;/a>), it really just depends on the person.  Experts tell us that people who drink very frequently may be able to function quite well, even at very high BACs.  Likewise, ask around and you'll find that many people have been to parties where the drinks were either very watered down or not alcoholic at all, and yet one person who didn't know this stumbled around saying, \"I'm getting sooo drunk!\"  Are they just faking?  No, experts say that a large part of how drunk we feel or act is in our heads.&lt;br />&lt;br />Other factors, besides a person's drinking history, is how much they've had to eat, their size, the types of drinks, the time period during which they had the drinks and the time period since the last drink.  &lt;br />&lt;br />(For example, imagine someone doing four shots of tequila and then immediately getting into a car to drive just a few blocks.  Science tells us that they can't yet be intoxicated - the alcohol hasn't had time to enter their bloodstream.  But imagine a cat jumps out in the street, they swerve to avoid it, and hit a parked car.  When the police come, they're going to smell the alcohol.  And by the time you get down to the station and take the test, he's going to blow a BAC much higher that what he had at the time of the accident.)&lt;br />&lt;br />So, why is this ad campaign driving me nuts?  What's so untrue about it?  It's a real under-exaggeration of the legal standard for intoxication.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Look again at the \"buzzed\" guy.  There aren't even any other empty glasses on the table!  And he didn't even finish that one drink!  True, he kind of bumped into the door.  Maybe he's just klutzy.  Or being gentlemanly and making sure there's enough room for his wife to get through the door.  I don't think there's anything to lead us to believe he's had much to drink except that one gulp we saw - and there's certainly nothing to lead us to believe he has had \"one drink too many.\"  Unless we're going along with MADD and saying that even one drink is one drink too many.&lt;br />&lt;br />Finally, what does all of this have to do with driving?  Are buzzed drivers causing accidents?  In general, the answer is no.  &lt;br />&lt;br />In the cases I've seen where a DWI arrest is made for someone driving with a BAC between .08 and around .12, nearly 100% of those arrests are made as the result of a checkpoint stop.  In other words, the drivers with BACs at or near .08 simply aren't drivers that are causing accidents.  Instead, in most of the DWI accident cases I've seen, and there's a lot of empirical evidence to support this, the BACs are higher - usually over .12.  These are clients that, even when I interview them hours later, still smell like alcohol, still have slurred speech, and often can't remember what happened.  &lt;br />&lt;br />But I understand that a cutoff needs to be set.  And I even agree that it should be set on the lower side, again, erring on the side of caution and keeping in mind that alcohol effects each person differently.  &lt;br />&lt;br />My real problem is with the use of the word \"buzzed,\" a very subjective word, that to some people may mean that first warm feeling you get from just a sip of alcohol, and to others it may mean something a lot closer to \"drunk.\"  &lt;br />&lt;br />(Kind of like some people think \"hooking up\" is something along the lines of making out or fooling around or whatever, and other people think \"hooking up\" means actual sex.  It's all just slang.  It's not like you can look it up in the dictionary and see what \"buzzed\" or \"hooking up\" means.)&lt;br />&lt;br />And it seems that maybe this commercial wants you to believe that \"buzzed\" could mean one drink or less.  There certainly is no further explanation as to how much the \"buzzed\" man in the commercial has had to drink.  And yet, it's being equated to drunk and illegal driving.  &lt;br />&lt;br />It's misleading and it's a misstatement of the law.  Many people rely on the media to tell them the state of the laws.  When a new law goes into effect, or a law is changed, people expect to hear about it on television.  I'm concerned that people will mistake this advertisement for a report on the current state of the law.  And, I don't want any juror who has seen this commercial or who believes it, for fear that they may substitute this advertisement's misstatement of the law for the actual law, despite the correct instructions from the judge."},

An older woman is clutching some of the pages, and she approaches a police officer, who is writing a parking ticket.&lt;br />&lt;br />Immediately, the police officer says to her, \"It's too late, lady, I already started writing the ticket.\"  &lt;br />&lt;br />After she tries to explain, he realizes that the pages she's holding have blood on them.  &lt;br />&lt;br />He finds the dead body, Detectives Fontana and Green show up.  They talk to the woman briefly about what she saw, and tell her that they'll get a car to take her home.&lt;br />&lt;br />Stop!  What's wrong with this scene?&lt;br />&lt;br />Yes, they would've gotten a car for the woman.  A police car.  To the station.  Where she would have been charged for bribery.  For approaching an officer who was writing a ticket, while holding papers out to him.&lt;br />&lt;br />The fact that it wasn't her car, or that she wasn't trying to get him to stop writing the ticket don't really matter.  That can all be sorted out after she spends a night in central booking.  &lt;br />&lt;br />And some brand new D.A., who took the job thinking she'll get some trial experience and make a difference in the world, makes a bail application about how this old woman obstructed justice AND bribed a police officer.  That she's a flight risk because she has a winter home in Florida.  Maybe, with the wrong judge on the bench, her kid will have to come post bail for her. &lt;br />&lt;br />Don't believe me?

It started to peek out in the comments to two of my recent posts (&lt;a href=\"http://blondejustice.blogspot.com/2005/11/trading-spouses.html\">here&lt;/a> and &lt;a href=\"http://blondejustice.blogspot.com/2005/11/amazing-race-zen.html\">here&lt;/a>).  At this point, I think I just need to put it out there.  So, here it goes.&lt;br />&lt;br />Where should I start?  I was raised Christian.  Protestant.  When I was young, my family and I went to church pretty regularly.  We didn't talk about God or religion a lot in my house, but my parents were involved in a bit of charity, particularly through community work.  We didn't pray before dinner, except on Thanksgiving or Christmas.  &lt;br />&lt;br />By the time I was in high school, my family became Christmas-and-Easter churchgoers.  I went to church a few times on campus in college, but just never really got into the habit.  &lt;br />&lt;br />In my current town, I'm a member of a church.  I, once again, go to Church regularly.  I volunteer, I do some community work, and I feel pretty strongly, as I've written here previously, that the work that I do has a strong religious component.&lt;br />&lt;br />But I've always just been very turned off by what I feel are \"preachy\" Christians.  Sure, you've found happiness in your Christianity, and you want to share that.  But I feel like there's a time and a place.  And, I know, I can see the obvious argument against that.  That Jesus didn't just spread the word when the time was right, but He did it all the time.  And maybe the fact that I'm uncomfortable with it somehow makes me less of a good Christian.&lt;br />&lt;br />But, I feel like some people spend too much time talking about what good Christians they are, and not enough time being good Christians.  And I feel that actions speak louder than words.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Last week, I was waiting in the doctor's office waiting room.  A woman came in, went up to the desk to check in for her appointment, and I noticed that she was up there for a long time, talking to the receptionist.  She then went and started talking to a woman in the waiting room.  I assumed that the woman she was talking to was a friend that was waiting with her.  I could overhear parts of her conversation.&lt;br />&lt;br />\"Ever since I found God in my life...\"&lt;br />\"The Lord is my Shepard...\"&lt;br />\"I am a woman of God...\"&lt;br />&lt;br />It was none of my business, so I tried not to pay attention.  But she was loud.  She was talking about how she had moved to a new neighborhood last year.  And before she even moved in, she had printed up flyers.  \"To tell them about me, about my kids, about my miracle of how I found God...\"  She invited everyone in the neighborhood, through these fliers, to a meeting at her house because she wanted to organize a neighborhood watch group.  \"I wanted them to know what my car looks like, and know what their cars look like, so if Satan comes to take our children, we're on the lookout.\"  (Wow, Satan drives a car now?)  To her surprise, no one from the neighborhood showed up at her meeting.  \"I guess they couldn't face a woman of God, knowing that they're all sinners.\"  Hmmm, gee that's it.  I couldn't help but think, \"Or maybe they already had a neighborhood watch group.  How about that?\"  But, like I said, none of my business.  I just wanted to read my crappy magazine from two years ago.&lt;br />&lt;br />She then got up, though, and went to an empty chair near two other women on the other side of the waiting room.  And I could hear her talking again.  I started to pay more attention, because I realized she wasn't with any of these people, she was just evangelizing to them.  &lt;br />&lt;br />I could hear her telling them this story.  Her kids, apparently, had either called the police on her or went to court about her.  (Or both.)  \"I never beat my kids,\" she said.  \"Sure, I spanked them, when they needed to be spanked, but I never beat them.\"  I don't know much about family court, but her children must have gone to court and gotten a restraining order and permission to live with their aunt.&lt;br />&lt;br />\"My sister!  My sister!  And she's a thief.  She used to steal from me all the time.  And she's not even a Christian!\"  So, the police had come to her house, and served her with the papers.  She started telling them about the word of God, and one of the police officers said something along the lines of, \"Yes, we were warned you were a lunatic.\"  &lt;br />&lt;br />And, now the woman was shouting in the waiting room.  \"I told him, you can call me crazy.  You can call me a Jesus freak.  But you cannot ever ever, I mean ever, call me a lunatic.  Because that is what they called My Lord.  And I'm not even half as good as Jesus Christ to fill his sandals!\"  &lt;br />&lt;br />All I could think was \"WTF?  When did they call Him a lunatic?  And, even if it's in your Bible, isn't that just a translation, when maybe a translation of 'crazy' could've been just as appropriate?\"  &lt;br />&lt;br />Well, finally, someone in the little reception window looked out to see what was going on, and I heard her say, \"Ethel, she's at it again, you have to go get her.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />And, with that, they called the lunatic's name to bring her into the doctor's office.  &lt;br />&lt;br />And as she walked in, she turned around to the entire waiting room and said, \"There's too much sin here on earth.  You've all invited Satan into your hearts.  And that's why you're sick and in the doctor's office.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />Me?  I was just there for a physical.  But I think we can all guess who the sick one is.&lt;br />&lt;br />That very night, I happened to catch &lt;a href=\"http://blondejustice.blogspot.com/2005/11/trading-spouses.html\">this crazy episode of Trading Spouses&lt;/a>.  One of the women was a Christian (the woman you see screaming in the commercials), and the other was more... spiritual.  (She classified herself as a Christian, but she also believes in astrology, hypnotism, etc.)  The Christian woman was very upset to be in a \"darksided\" home.  &lt;br />&lt;br />But what upset me more was the way that the Christian woman's friends treated the hypnotist lady.  They're in Louisiana, and the hypnotist lady invites all of the Christian lady's friends over for a dinner.  She hopes that it will be good for her to get more insight into the family she's staying with, and ways to connect with the kids.  &lt;br />&lt;br />One of the women, as soon as she walked in, said \"Are you a Christian?\"  The hypnotist answered, \"Yes.\"  The woman asked, \"Well, do you believe in (finger quotes) 'God' or do you believe in (finger quotes) 'a higher power'?\"  The hypnotist lady answered, \"I believe in God.\"  \"Well, when was the last time you went to Church?\"  &lt;br />&lt;br />The hypnotist explained that she was raised Catholic, and that she's now a member of a Unitarian congregation.  \"Well, what do they believe?\" the Christian friend asked.  &lt;br />&lt;br />\"We believe that all people are created equal...\"  before she could even finish, the woman interrupted, \"What?  Like the terrorists and the pedophiles?\"  &lt;br />&lt;br />I just think this is so hypocritical.  First of all, this woman is welcoming you into \"her\" home.  (No, it's not really her home, but it is for the time being.)  And before you even get in the doorway, you're interrogating her, interrupting her, and judging her?  To me, that's not Christian.  The hypnotist woman is a better Christian, because she's the one who is taking the time to get to know other people, and to try to understand them and connect to them.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Then, finally, on that same night, was &lt;a href=\"http://blondejustice.blogspot.com/2005/11/amazing-race-zen.html\">this episode of Amazing Race&lt;/a>, which, through the miracle of Tivo, I didn't watch until the next night.  &lt;br />&lt;br />This season, there's a family called The Weavers (also known as \"the Florida family\").  They make for the best television, and I think that all of the dumb American quotes that I've featured here have been from them.  &lt;br />&lt;br />And, as you can see from the comments, they're rude to other teams, make fun of other teams (not that I wouldn't), and then say, \"Why doesn't anyone like us?  We're good Christians!\"  &lt;br />&lt;br />Being a good Christian isn't something you just say, it's something you do.  In fact, I think that the more you have to say it, probably the less you're actually doing it.  &lt;br />&lt;br />And, &lt;a href=\"http://blondejustice.blogspot.com/2005/11/amazing-race-zen.html#c113128713484645759\">as my father says&lt;/a>, \"Be nice, those people chose your President.\"  I guess he's right.  I guess there's some majority in this country of people who are more comfortable saying \"I'm a Christian\" and telling others how to live a Christian life, then they are just living a Christian life - accepting others, and practicing peace.&lt;br />&lt;br />And they chose one for President too.  He can sure talk about Christianity, all the while standing by while people get killed in war and by the death penalty, obviously ignoring the commandment, \"Thou shall not kill.\"  But, maybe he figures if he gets someone else to do it for him, it doesn't count?&lt;br />&lt;br />So, that's all for my rant.  I'm annoyed at these people.  I think they give a bad name to Christians everywhere."},

It's unfortunate that it's not on NBC, I think it'd make good law school viewing (and, I assume law students are more likely to catch something that's on NBC than on Bravo).  One of the recent episodes (1 or 2 weeks ago, I guess?  I've been watching them off Tivo, so I'm not sure when it aired) brought up an interesting ethical issue:  Can you read to the jury from a document that you know to be untrue, a document signed by your client, after you didn't allow your client to testify because you knew she'd be perjuring herself (and the document that you read was essentially the same as what her perjured testimony would've been)?  What if your adversary opens the door by mentioning another part of the same document?&lt;br />&lt;br />My best instincts say no, duty of candor to the court, blah blah blah, but I guess if I were in that situation at the very least I'd request a recess and research it and speak to someone about it.  (Some states have an ethics hotline that you can call with this kind of dilemma, if you don't have a senior attorney that you can consult.)&lt;br />&lt;br />In the end, though, it didn't seem to make a difference to Roy Black, or whoever is actually making the decisions, because the attorney who engaged in the ethically questionable behavior was not dismissed.  In fact, I don't think he even commented on it in the final \"board room\" scene.&lt;br />&lt;br />Also, my favorite attorney, Chris, who I believe may have been a public defender was \"dismissed\" in the most recent episode, so I was disappointed by that.&lt;br />&lt;br />The point is, it's getting pretty good, so tune in if you've got Bravo."},

For example... \"Happy\" wonders why the prosecutor didn't present more evidence about when the defendant was moved from one police car to another.  For example, he didn't mention how far the distance was, whether she was assisted, etc.  But, I would wonder if he didn't bring it up because it was a bad fact for him.  Maybe she walked a few hundred feet gracefully and without assistance, so it wouldn't be something the prosecutor would mention.   I'm not saying that would have made a difference in the verdict, but I guess that's how I would analyze the evidence that is presented (or isn't).&lt;br />&lt;br />\"Happy\" also wonders whether the defendant was represented by a public defender, based on the fact that there was a law student second seating the trial.  I'd say that that's probably true.  (Unless it was summer, which makes it slightly more likely that the law student was a summer associate at a law firm.)  But what I really want to know is, would it have made a difference if you knew that?&lt;br />&lt;br />I would think that in a drunk driving case, it wouldn't really matter whether the client is rich or poor.  Rich people are just as capable of committing this crime as poor people (and celebrities get arrested for it all the time).  &lt;br />&lt;br />On the other hand, I do worry about jurors knowing that my client is represented by a public defender in a case like crack possession or shoplifting (although, who can forget Winona Ryder?)  &lt;br />&lt;br />Here's what I think is more interesting... do you think the defendant was in jail while the case was pending?  Probably not, on a drunk driving, but it might give you a clue as to what her warrant was for (presumably something more serious if she was in jail).  Generally, courts try to hide this information, but sometimes it's unavoidable that a juror sees the defendant entering the courthouse, either in handcuffs or not.  And, of course, is it a good factor or a bad factor?  &lt;br />&lt;br />Perhaps a juror, learning that a client was in jail, would think, \"She may be guilty of something, but not something &lt;i>that&lt;/i> serious, she shouldn't be in jail, I'll lean toward acquittal.\"  On the other hand, I think a juror might just as easily say, \"If they put her in jail during this case, she must have some really bad criminal record or done something more serious that they didn't tell us about... and therefore she's more likely to be guilty of whatever she's accused of now.\"  &lt;br />&lt;br />So, I guess that's all my thoughts on that.  Except...&lt;br />Next time, ACQUIT!  &lt;br />&lt;br />Just kidding.  =) &lt;br />At least partially."},

Perimenopause is defined as the period beginning with the signs of approaching menopause and ending about 12 months after \u201cthe menopause\u201d.&lt;br />&lt;br />Worldwide, menopause has as a variety of meanings. Each and every woman\u2019s experience is based on her physical and emotional well being as well as her social and cultural environments. While some view menopause as a decline in status, others see it as a rite of passage. In other words, there are huge physical, emotional and social influences involved in your experience of menopause and aging.&lt;br />&lt;br />That said, what you really want to know is \u2013 \u201cWhat will I experience\u201d?&lt;br />&lt;br />This is tricky, as the answer is different for every woman. Some women barely notice a warm flush, while others have an intense reaction. So as you read some of the more common occurrences, please keep in mind \u2013 you will do your own thing.&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>Power Surges, night sweats (they can be all day!) and chills&lt;/li>&lt;li>Insomnia, and/or poor quality of sleep&lt;/li>&lt;li>Urinary frequency, discomfort and sometimes leakiness&lt;/li>&lt;li>Vaginal dryness, irritation and possibly discomfort with sexual activity&lt;/li>&lt;li>Moodiness. Perhaps some irritation, nervousness, anxiety and depression.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Diminished libido (sexual desire)&lt;/li>&lt;li>Memory issues! Some women call this \u201cthe pause\u201d (among other things).&lt;/li>&lt;li>Joint pain and stiffness&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;p>In case you think all the reactions are negative, take a look at some of the more positive and more important changes that happen to women. &lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Freedom&lt;/li>&lt;li>Joy&lt;/li>&lt;li>Greater sense of Creativity&lt;/li>&lt;li>A sense of peace that has not been previously been present.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Wisdom that only comes to those with time and conscious living.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;p>Just as there are many responses to the onset of menopause, there are many approaches you can take to meet these changes. As with anything, you must weigh any risk against the benefit (this is especially true when you consider hormone therapy), your belief system, and finally, you must find something that works for you.&lt;br />&lt;br />Most approaches are common sense and actions we need to take daily. Others are meant to challenge your thinking and open your mind. Possible ways to approach menopause include: &lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Healthy food and fluid intake&lt;/li>&lt;li>Nutriceuticals such as vitamins and herbal supplements&lt;/li>&lt;li>Exercise at least 30 minutes daily&lt;/li>&lt;li>Traditional Chinese Medicine such has acupuncture, Chinese herbs, Qi Gong and Tai Chi&lt;/li>&lt;li>Adjust your attitude! Laugh and have fun. Hang out with your girlfriends and delight in NOT being 25 again!&lt;/li>&lt;li>Meditation, visualization and biofeedback&lt;/li>&lt;li>Natural, Bio-identical and pharmaceutical grade hormone therapy&lt;/li>&lt;br />&lt;/ul>This is a time of your life where you can count on change, and the growth that comes from it. As the power surges through our bodies, we grow into the women we are meant to be. We fulfill our goals and move on to make new ones. While our focus is inward, our outward gaze sharpens and our dreams are manifested for all to celebrate. It really is a magnificent time.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the coming months, OlderWiserWomen will explore these areas in greater detail, so stay tuned.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u00a92005 Barbara C.

Scourge in point: the computer cheater. All too often, people will fire up their chess software in the background, or on a second machine, or even directly to the server interface and attempt to steal victories, rating points and occasionally even money from their victims. Often they're caught - sometimes sooner, sometimes later - but they're always a nuisance.&lt;br />&lt;br />They don't always succeed, however - sometimes the good guys absorb the computer's blows and survive or even win. What follows is one of my more satisfying online victories, over a player I realized early on was a computer cheat.&lt;br />&lt;br />Bad Guy-DM, 15-minute game, ICC 2000&lt;br />&lt;br />1.Nf3 Nf6 2.d4 d5 3.Bf4 g6 4.e3 Bg7 5.Be2 Nbd7 6.O-O O-O 7.Nbd2 b6 8.c3 Bb7 9.Qa4 c5 10.Rfe1 a6 11.Qd1&lt;br />&lt;br />At this point, I suddenly feel suspicious. My opponent is a good player, his rating is fairly high, so what's with 9.Qa4 one move and 11.Qd1 two moves later? The retreat might be sensible, but it's not the sort of move a human would just play, and quickly, if only because of the embarrassment factor.&lt;br />&lt;br />11...Ne4 12.Rb1 Rc8 13.Qc2&lt;br />&lt;br />Okay, now I'm getting &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic;\">really&lt;/span> suspicious! Why not 9.Qc2 or 11.Qc2? And who makes such a move in response to my putting a rook on the c-file? That's the sort of thing strong players typically (though defeasibly) avoid!&lt;br />&lt;br />13...Re8 14.Rbc1 Nxd2 15.Qxd2 Nf6 16.Qd1&lt;br />&lt;br />Sigh. I always make a point of not bothering playing computers, but it's clear that's what I'm up against. As it's against the rules to use a chess engine (unless one's account is explicitly marked as a computer account), I started to request that the game be aborted. My opponent refused, and we continued:&lt;br />&lt;br />16...Ne4 17.Bd3 b5 18.a4 Qb6 19.axb5 axb5 20.Ne5 Red8&lt;br />&lt;br />Annoyed though I was, I felt pretty good about my position, but I was in for a surprise, as my opponent produced an extremely strong idea:&lt;br />&lt;br />21.Ra1! b4 22.Qb1!&lt;br />&lt;br />This is a fantastic prophylactic idea, as playing 22...bxc3 23.bxc3 favors White. I attempt a tactical solution to my problems, but my opponent is more than up to the challenge:&lt;br />&lt;br />22...Nd2 23.Qc2 bxc3 24.bxc3 Nb3 25.Ra4! c4 26.Rb4! Qa7&lt;br />&lt;br />Very nice play by White, who was moving extremely quickly, too, and taking pretty much the same amount of time on every move (another tell-tale sign of the computer cheat). What follows now is even more impressive, both as a chess idea and as evidence of the cheating claim:&lt;br />&lt;br />27.Bf1 e6 28.Bxc4!&lt;br />&lt;br />A very strange sequence - why not 27.Bxc4 straight away? That sort of freedom from embarrassment about past moves is typical of computers, but not at all of humans.&lt;br />&lt;br />28...dxc4 29.Nxc4 Bd5 30.Nb6 Nxd4 31.exd4 Rc6 32.Qb2 Bf8 33.Nxd5 exd5 34.Rb7 Qa3 35.Qxa3 Bxa3 36.Rb3 Bf8 37.h3 Re6&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://chessmind.powerblogs.com/files/NN_DM_1.jpg\" />&lt;br />&lt;br />White's play so far has been quite strong, and although overall I've played pretty well for a 15-minute game, my inaccuracies here and there have left it with an extra pawn. It's not the greatest extra pawn in the world, but it's certainly up to me to prove that I can hold the position.&lt;br />&lt;br />From here on out, however, White's play is bad in a way that would have been impossible for a human player exhibiting White's strength so far. The problem for White is that his queenside pawns are on dark squares while Black's are on light squares, thereby making White's bishop essentially impotent. Thus what's clear is that if the rooks are removed, it's a trivially easy task for Black to hold. Accordingly, White should avoid the exchange of at least one pair of rooks, when Black will have to suffer and grovel. But behold!&lt;br />&lt;br />38.Rxe6?! fxe6 39.Rb6 Kf7 40.Rb7+ Kg8 41.Kf1 Rc8 42.Rc7?? Rxc7 43.Bxc7&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://chessmind.powerblogs.com/files/NN_DM_2.jpg\" />&lt;br />&lt;br />Wow, that was easy! The position is perfect for me now - all my pawns are ideally placed, and White pawn advances simply lead to exchanges. I was way behind on the clock (I had two minutes left to White's seven and a half), but as I only need to play Kf7, Be7-f8-e7-f8-e7-f8 and trade the pawns as they come, I figured I'd have good chances to save the draw in spite of the clock.&lt;br />&lt;br />43...Kf7 44.Be5 Be7 45.Ke2 Bf8 46.Kd2 Be7 47.c4 dxc4 48.Kc3 Bf8 49.Kxc4 Be7&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://chessmind.powerblogs.com/files/NN_DM_3.jpg\" />&lt;br />&lt;br />and now check out White's next three moves, which taken together are completely insane.&lt;br />&lt;br />50.g3?! Bf8 51.h4?? Be7 52.f4? h5!&lt;br />&lt;br />Now it's really, really, really a dead draw, as White can never create so much as a single target in my position. But White finds resources in the position...for Black.&lt;br />&lt;br />53.Kd3 Bf8 54.Ke4 Be7 55.d5 exd5+ 56.Kxd5 Bf8 57.Kc6? Ke6 58.Kb5 Kf5 59.Kc6?? Bb4&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://chessmind.powerblogs.com/files/NN_DM_4.jpg\" />&lt;br />&lt;br />and now, of course, it's over, as my bishop hoovers the White pawns.&lt;br />&lt;br />60.Kd7 Be1 61.Ke8 Bxg3 62.Kf8 Bxh4 63.Kg7 Bg3 64.Kh6 Bxf4+ 65.Bxf4 Kxf4 66.Kxg6 h4 0-1&lt;br />&lt;br />After the game I reported my opponent to the server's computer-cheat police, and some time later my judgement was confirmed. It's disappointing when people do that, but to be honest, it did make the win much, much sweeter than it would otherwise have been! (Not because it was a computer that was defeated, which is certainly pleasant enough, but because a cheater got his just desserts.)"},
