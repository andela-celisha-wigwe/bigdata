The primary claim I make is that higher education circles, both faculty structures and administrative units have chosen, or have chosen for them technologies which invite individual creativity, but in the end hamper coordination and intergration key for both faculty and administrators alike. The sources appear to range from inappropriate fascination with the promise of open source code, to the dominance of Unix systems to manage domain control as well as drive university websites.  On the opposite end, the rise intrinsically integrating systems driven by enterprise class relational databases working in tandem with J2EE and Visual Studio have been dismissed as supposedly too corporate. In reality, I think it reveals an absence of understanding of current administrative tools and their strengths.  This weblog invites thoughtful discussion on these topic from any and all sources."},

The nasdaq 100 trust, symbol QQQ is comprised of 100 companies that trade on the NASDAQ exchange, the NYSE's little brother. This effectively is a mutual fund for the top 100 Nasdaq companies. Ebay, cisco and many other internet bubble era stocks make up this little time bomb. As usual, the two years prior to an election, the govt does everything within its power to turn any perilous economic tides so their regime can stay in power for another go-round. Here we are, 5 months out and the propoganda machine is in full force \"more jobs are being created, the stock market is doing 20% better than a yera ago today\". Stocks as a whole are overpriced, the techs and other profitless wonders such as Amazon.com have been flying the last 2 years. Once the election party is over, and booze no longer floweth, our hangover will soon set in. \"How do you know this\" you're asking. I don't, I have no magic pills or Nostradamian vision, but history is a great predictor of the future. Historically stocks trade at a PRICE/EARNINGS ratio of around 15. Ebay and Cisco are now at 108 and 36 respectively. There are a confluence of other factors that will turn the economic tide in the coming months. The price of oil, interest rates increasing, the successful or unsuccessful detachment from Iraq that is supposed to occur this summer, as well as issues with china are all concerns. My not-so-crystal ball tells me that we can count on at least two of those things increasing in severity and negatively affecting the market. So, stocks are overpriced, shit and fan are soon to meet. I see a few ways to play this. I'll set the time horizon as a year from the election, roughly a year and a half from today. The risky play with a chance for doubling your money would be buying  QQQ puts (options, that win if the stock goes down) with a January 2006 expiration. Enough time to let the shit hit the fan, and enough lag time to bail out of the position if the time doesnt turn after this election. I like the $36 puts, they demand a $4 per share premium, which means you would make a dime until the stocks drops below $32, but glancing at the 2 year chart it seems highly likely. In the year following the previous election, EBays value dropped by half, along with many others that comprise the QQQ play. Better odds than blackjack, and you have the option to pull out if you dont like how the cards are laid out in the next few months. The middle of the road play would be gold stocks. Not cheap today either, but cheap by comparision, and classically they thrive when the Index's fall. I like Goldcorp (my major holding), AEM,and NEM, for stable plays, IAG and GSS for riskier plays. The other obvious option is to warm the bench and watch the action from the sidelines. People often do in down markets because they dont understand how to make money when the market falls. Next blog will explain that."},

One of my resolutions (well u can\u2019t really call it a resolution) for this year was to maintain a journal. But then the year got off to a rollercoaster start and before two weeks had gone by I had landed in the US of A. In the midst of all the relocation n stuff maintaining my journal was tough! I just got one page done \u2013 which sucked. Besides, what was I thinking with the ol\u2019 paper n pen stuff anyways! So well that explains why I am finally here. I hope to capture my reflections here hence forth. Considering that I m new to this it may take a while for my posts to mature. But since I m writing this for myself \u2013 I don\u2019t care what any person (I \u2018d be lucky) who stops by may think \u2013 at least for now (Sorry folks \u2013 don\u2019t intend to sound rude). So here goes\u2026&lt;br />&lt;br />I was sent across to Silver Spring, MD for a project with a major telecom provider in the US from my company back home in India. Well I m not getting into details which are reserved only for people who know me. Had a very long flight considering the 7hrs transit time ( 3hrs at Dubai and 4 at Paris), but then who gets to see Dubai International, Charles De Gaule and Dulles Intl, Washington in a single trip. All of em real neat airports in their own way. Luckily had some guys here who could pick me up (though 2hrs late \u2013 Dulles is huger than it appears) and put me up for the first couple of weeks!&lt;br />&lt;br />From this evening I ll be in my own apartment. Setting up a place and stocking it was not an easy task in the least for me n my roomie coz we lacked our own wheels and weather did\u2019nt help either \u2013 its just stopped snowing. Not having a Social Security No. is the worst thing. Everything in this country is driven by it! We should be pretty much settled down in the coming week if everything works as planned. On the professional side \u2013 well u bet there\u2019s been loads happening \u2013 lots which I can\u2019t put here. But I guess this is a lot for a single post \u2013 so I ll sift through those details and add later.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;/blockquote>"},

Or the idea that this sem is quickly coming to an end. Meaning just one thing: EXAMS. Sigh.. &lt;br />&lt;br />But anyhow, i'm stil gonna take full advantage of the break. A chance to catch up on the movies i've missed! :D Our term break coincides with the NTU peeps as well, so maybe we could sacrifice one day frm our bz lives to do smthg together. Nothg's planned as yet though. We'll see how it goes... &lt;br />&lt;br />K, gotta go get ready now. Meeting Idri later for a movie &amp; some shopping. Keanu Reeves, here i come! :D&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />P.S: Almost forgot. Me and Nis saw Zach a few days back. No biggie though. Just thot i shld mention it, cos that was actually the 1st time i saw him since TPJC. Fyi, my heart didnt do somersaults or anythg like that. That was soooooo 8-years-ago. haha!"},

I'm a pitcher for softball and I did fairly well in it during high school and some other on the side teams. Possibly having a chance to play in college. Because of all this my name circled around the softball area often. The other day I was asked to go help coach a little league team because the coach almost didn't know what to do any more on this level. Once i got there it was about 8 little girl's faces that showed pride for once. I showed them some new small things and helped tume up old ones. But they acutally felt good for once to play. Yesterday we played another area team and their pitcher scared the little team i coach. i talked to them and they then had confidence. This team we were playing beat up 10-0 last match up. But through PRIDE and HARD WORK we managed to come out with a 1-0 lost. Not the best but a major achievement."},

I have. While reading the latest teen magazine out there, US Weekly, I noticed the obscene amounts of saccharine smiles and silicone appendages. So the plasticity and permacheer that made that dear old Mattel product unique, is now made obsolete by the starlets. - Why is that? - Two reasons. First, unlike Barbie, they can have a different facial structure. Secondly, they can date men with names other than Ken. -Doesn't Barbie have anything over them? - Why of course!

A year almost to the day.&lt;br />&lt;br />But I'm back and I have more to say about why some girls piss me off.&lt;br />&lt;br />Girls who are bored are DANGEROUS.&lt;br />They don't like being bored so they think up crazy idiotic things to do to counter the boredom.&lt;br />Bad bad bad.&lt;br />&lt;br />If they don't have a boyfriend...They try to find one. Usually in the stupidest most unappealing back handed way. That is of coarse they're at least intelligent enough to not do the whole online/ met in a chat room thing (which most of that aren't). They usually end up going for the most pathetic losers that you could imagine just so they have something (or someone) to do.&lt;br />&lt;br />Or instead of actually looking for a boyfriend they just complain about not having one. ALL THE TIME. I am afraid to mention the word boyfriend around half of my so called female friends because it just gets them going about about how sad their lives are without one. HELLO!!!!! You're a girl you don't need a guy to make your life mean something. Sure it's nice and it's great to know that someone special cares about you...But if you can't function just b/c you don't have a boyfriend your not worth going out with anyway. Unless of coarse you've found a pathetic guy who's just as bad and has to have a girlfriend all the time, then you two losers are perfect for each other.&lt;br />&lt;br />Then of coarse what about the girls who think gossip is the ultimate pass time. Those girls who sit around in they're spare time (that they unfortunately have oh so much of in the summer) and do nothing but spread rumors and lies about people. Some of which are suppose to be their &lt;em>friends.&lt;/em> I mean obviously some time things get spread around just from simple miscommunication... BUT COME ON. I've seen so many relationships break up just because so and so said something to the wrong person and it was a completely false statement, but no one stopped to check the facts before everyone blew up and the relationship was over. It's ridiculous.&lt;br />&lt;br />Ok I think that's enough for today.&lt;br />Good bye."},

It was one of those moments of excruciating longing without knowing exactly what it is we long for.&lt;br />Now London feels like a dream.  The only evidence I have of ever living there is an extra five kilos and a recreational drug habit.&lt;br />Andrew and I have found our own place in Brunswick, which is blissful after living with seven boisterous Aussies in Shepherds Bush.  I now work for a less pointy-end of the cause - the Environment Department in local government.  I enjoy my work and being surrounded by like-minded, passionate people... but being confined to an office is difficult!  Many a wistful gaze I cast out the window, reminiscing about sultry mid-summer London and Acton Park Lodge.  If instead of writing that last post I'd have walked outside to the lodge garden, I would've been treated to the hum of dragonflies which decorate the pond.  I may have caught the burnt orange tail of our resident fox disappearing behind the back fence.  My head would have filled with the intoxicating smell of things growing.&lt;br />The screen's becoming blurry behind my magenta-coloured glasses.   Australia is equally beautiful - I just feel out of touch with nature in my current office-bound position.  Coming home to a patch of concrete and callistemon in the back garden just doesn't really cut it!  I miss the open-mindedness of people in London too, and the willingness of other transients to make friends.&lt;br />I'm off to have a glass of wine with my boy.  I spend enough time staring at a screen at work, and he looks like he needs a hug tonight.  Here's hoping I'll be needing to purge my thoughts / waste some time again shortly- I might actually manage a THIRD entry!"},

You work very odd hours.&lt;br />2. You are paid a lot of money to keep your client happy.&lt;br />3. You are paid well but your pimp gets most of the money.&lt;br />4. You spend a majority of your time in a location of your client\u2019s choosing.&lt;br />5. You charge by the hour but your time can be extended.&lt;br />6. You are not proud of what you do.&lt;br />7. Creating fantasies for your clients is rewarded.&lt;br />8. It\u2019s difficult to have a family.&lt;br />9. You have no job satisfaction.&lt;br />10. If a client beats you up, the pimp just sends you to another client.&lt;br />11. You are embarrassed to tell people what you do for a living.&lt;br />12. People ask you, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d and you can\u2019t explain it.&lt;br />13. Your client pays for your hotel room plus your hourly rate.&lt;br />14. Your client always wants to know how much you charge and what they get for the money.&lt;br />15. Your pimp drives a nice car.&lt;br />16. Your pimp encourages drinking and you become addicted to ease the pain of it all.&lt;br />17. You know the pimp is charging more than you are worth but if the  client is foolish enough to pay it\u2019s not your problem.&lt;br />18. When you leave to go see a client, you look great, but return looking like hell.&lt;br />19. You are rated on your \u201cperformance\u201d in an excruciating ordeal.&lt;br />20. Even though you get paid the big bucks, it\u2019s the client who walks away smiling.&lt;br />21. The client always thinks your \u201ccut\u201d of your billing rate is higher than it actually is, and in turn, expects miracles from you.&lt;br />22. When you deduct your \u201ctake\u201d from your billing rate, you constantly wonder if you could get a better deal with another pimp.&lt;br />23. Your pimp seems to often abuse you, forgetting that without you, he would not have a business.&lt;br />24. You do all the real work, but the pimp has a higher status and more money, and really just has to \u201ccoordinate\u201d the work for you. Sometimes, you wonder if you could just make more money pimping out yourself.&lt;br />25. You get so brainwashed into the lifestyle, that you don\u2019t realize that life can be better, until it is too late.&lt;br />26. Personal time, or a work/life balance, is meaningless to your pimp, all he cares about is satisfying the clients, despite how many times he tells you he loves you.&lt;br />27. After a few years, you find that all your non-prostitute friends are no longer your friends, because you lost touch and your schedule and lifestyle was difficult to manage. Now you find that you associate primarily with other prostitutes.&lt;br />28. The turnover rate is ridiculously high. Everyone thinks they can do it for a few years, no problem, but after just a few clients railing you, many break under the pressure, or quit for a better life.&lt;br />29. Most of the time, your job could be performed by a well-trained monkey.&lt;br />30. You do what you\u2019re told, and pass further inquiry."},

What have you got to say?' They asked him this as a test, looking for an accusation to use against him. But Jesus bent down and started writing on the ground with this finger. As they persisted with their question, he straightened up and said, 'Let the one among you who is guiltless be the first to throw a stone at her.' Then he bent down and continued writing on the ground. When they heard this they wentaway one by one, beginning with the eldest, until the last one had gone and Jesus was left alone with the woman, who remained in the middle. Jesus again straightened up and said, 'Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?' 'No one, sir,' she replied. 'Neither do I condemn you,' said Jesus. 'Go away, and from this moment sin no more.'\" --John 8:2-11"},

I watched a little NBC News, a little Bravo, a little Food Channel etc.   It makes the flight go way faster to have all the choice.

I was suppose to go to Sarah's today to do Pilates. But my mom asked me to church cuz Adam was going. I went there and I wasn't seeing \"Chris\" and I was about to leave but then I see my parents so we go in and sit on the opposite sides where we usually sit. I look back and I think I see \"Chris\" but I wasnt' quite sure it's been like a month and a half. I tell my mom I'm gonna go back there. Then a minuate later she says she's going to the back cuz her back hurts. So we follow her and I stand by \"Chris.\" He smelled soooooo good. I got all nervous cuz I was going to hold his hand. So anyways I was waiting all church trying to think what I can say to him to talk to him. At the end of Mass I ask him where are your parents? Aren't they usually with you. He said you mean my mom? She usually goes to the 12 o'clock mass. (So then I start thinking maybe this isn't \"Chris\" cuz \"Chris's\" parents go with him at 5:30. I say my names Sarah and he told me his name is Tommy. (So this defentily isn't \"Chris\") We talk. He's gonna be a Pilot and I saw his driverslience and I think he's 21. Then he abrubly is like I'm parked in the back. I'll see you around. So not only do I feel like an idiot, cuz I could barly speak. Plus come to find out. My parents lied to me. They told me they Met \"Chris\" and he asked about me, and we hadn't eve spoke. This whole time I thought this Hot guy I wanted asked about me and his name was \"Chris.\" Plus I mixed up Tommy with Chris. They look alike. There both hot. I don't think I will go to Mass next week. I'm an Idiot."},

It's been a long time since I have written anything down. The question that I have asked myself so far when I have looked back on my previous posts is whether or not I am completely satisfied with what I have achieved so far and I can honestly say that the answer is no. I do not wish to put a negative spin on things, it's just that I need to take some time to reflect on what I can do to help myself accomplish more in life so that I can make my life meaningful and beneficial.&lt;br />&lt;br />I am all about achieving something better than what I have. It is the way that the task is taken on, by the horns of the bull, sort of speak, that I tend to focus and learn. Otherwise nothing gets accomplished. So what needs to be addressed at this moment that is in full frontal view in my life? What have I not looked at or avoided because I was too afraid to persevere? Is this goal attainable? Have I thought of one, or are there some in the process of achieving? There are always goals to achieve.&lt;br />&lt;br />Some might say that we focus our energy into some things because we are too scared to look at the bigger picture. Has it ever happened to you that you suddenly feel like vacuuming the car when you have a really important paper due? Or watched a few hours of TV when you really could use that time towards something more meaningful? I am so flighty when it comes to really focusing on what I want. When am I going to learn to put the blinders on and just focus! Or as one of the roofers said once, just fucus! (He had an accent)&lt;br />&lt;br />So I am going to ask myself these questions:&lt;br />&lt;br />1.     What is it that I want to do with my life?&lt;br />&lt;br />2.     What kind goal is important to me that I can achieve in the near future?&lt;br />&lt;br />3.     When can that goal be achieved?&lt;br />&lt;br />4.     Are there goals that I am achieving right now that are benefital to that future accomplishment?&lt;br />&lt;br />5.     If so what are they?&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />Now the first question I think is very broad, and it takes a lot of effort to really think of an answer for that one, because what I want to do with my life isn't necessarily what I am going to get, but I have to put in the efforts to make it happen. Before I reap the rewards, I have to sow the seeds. So that's why the next question needs to be addressed.&lt;br />&lt;br />The second question addresses things like job related, health related, education related.... etc. You may have something in mind like wanting to lose 50 lbs, or wanting to further a career path, or making time to schedule in a few courses. Make that goal attainable, realistic and use time frames so that you know that you have a fixed schedule to achieve something. &lt;br />&lt;br />If there is no time schedule, then I'm pretty sure that the goal will not be achieved. So I have a few goals in mind. To obtain my degree. When will that be achieved? I don't really know exactly but I wish to take no longer than 6 years since I am going part time. To date I have 30 credits under my belt, and I am currently taking 12. I need 120 to graduate. So that leaves me with 78 credits to get. Or 13 six credit courses. The price that I will pay may be about $15,000 more or plus. So I will see how it will go. &lt;br />&lt;br />Another thing that I have always had an issue with is my weight. I am currently around 230 lbs. I have even gone as far as to think of perhaps looking into gastric laparoscopic surgery. I have written an email to a surgeon in my area and got a response. The estimated amount this might cost me depending on the route that I take is approximately $15,000. So right now getting surgery is not an option and it is a last desperate cry I believe. So what are the alternatives?&lt;br />&lt;br />Diet and exercise, seems to be a reasonable suggestion yes? I think so too. I feel though I have too much on my plate right now. Working part time, and school part time... trying to fit in things all together is difficult, and requires a lot of organization. *And all I see right now are excuses to not go out and do something about it.* Let's focus on the positive instead... So in the past summer, I went out and joined the walking club. I did a 10k walk with them, and I really enjoyed it.&lt;br />&lt;br />If I could perhaps, get back to a regular routine of getting up early and going to the gym. Getting up at say 7:30 and going to the gym for 2 hours, I would have enough time to go home and get ready for work by 12. I also was given a gift certificate to a personal trainer. Have I used it yet? No, not yet. But I am planning to use it when I go back to weight watchers. I think that's the route I'm going to take again. I have tried alternatives, such as TOPS (take off the pounds sensibly) but I think the best route so far has been WW, plus they meet on a day when I can make it to their meetings.&lt;br />&lt;br />So when do I plan to make this all happen? What am I going to really focus on doing? I am going to say this. By some time in April, I plan on going back to weight watchers. When this happens, and when I start making this an on going thing (Remember the alternative how much it would cost for surgery?) I am going to start talking to someone at the gym about obtaining a personal trainer. If I don't do this, I am going to post a picture of myself that I don't like.&lt;br />&lt;br />So what is the plan?&lt;br />&lt;br />Start getting up early and going to the gym.&lt;br />&lt;br />By April, join WW.&lt;br />&lt;br />By my birthday: Get a trainer.&lt;br />&lt;br />If I don't do these things by my birthday: Ugly picture of me on the internet! Eep O_o&lt;br />&lt;br />There's motivation for you! Bye for now.. see you next update."},

He sends out a memo telling county employees not to misuse the county\u2019s electronic mail system.&lt;br />That doesn\u2019t exactly set you to whistling \u201cYankee Doodle Dandy.\u201d&lt;br />Background: a tax office employee sent out an email relating an incident she said she heard occurred at an Angleton convenience store, where the owner supposedly said \u201cAmerica got what it deserved\u201d in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.&lt;br />The email got passed around hither and yon, as emails tend to do in times like these.&lt;br />Some way the email made its way to the county judge\u2019s office.&lt;br />The email writer said in her missive that the convenience store owner who uttered the anti-American statement ought to be shut down.&lt;br />Now, we don\u2019t know if the Angleton convenience store owner really said what he supposedly said.&lt;br />If he did, well, that\u2019s OK, though unfortunate. There\u2019s still free speech in this country, both for the email writer and the convenience store fellow (if he really exists).&lt;br />But was it really necessary for Judge Willy to issue a formal statement that announced the county wouldn\u2019t tolerate misuse of the email system to target individuals or groups?&lt;br />Couldn\u2019t he have just picked up the phone and told the employee to knock it off, to calm down, to take a chill pill?&lt;br />I guarantee you, word would have got around the courthouse after that.&lt;br />But instead the judge issues the formal statement to employees, department heads and elected officials. Which of course gets in the local newspaper. Very unnecessary.&lt;br />Sometimes it\u2019s better to work underneath the radar.&lt;br />Now is not the time for anyone to carried away.&lt;br />It\u2019s not time for traditional-looking Americans (you decide what that means) to bash Americans who don\u2019t look like traditional Americans, and it\u2019s not time for our elected officials to hit the panic button over an email writer who got a little carried away one day.&lt;br />posted by Banjo Jones 8:41 PM &lt;br />9.21.2001 &lt;br />&lt;br />Scenes from a hospital&lt;br />&lt;br />I had never spent much time in an intensive care unit, never as patient and only this past week because my father has been seriously ill.&lt;br />The waiting room is where you see the families gather. Some are in tears, others stare blankly at the TV. There is a phone for family and friends on the outside to call in for progress reports.&lt;br />When it rings, whooever\u2019s nearest the phone picks it up. If it\u2019s not for them, they find out who the caller is seeking, then calls out their last name. Nobody minds answering the phone, it gives them something to do besides wait.&lt;br />You see the same faces day in, day out, and a casual familiarity soon grows. You find out a little about why your fellow ICU-waiters are there and you tell them why you\u2019re present.&lt;br />The TV news, even when it\u2019s about momentous events such as the pending war against Osama Bin Laden, is of only passing interest because the crisis with which you\u2019re dealing is much closer to the heart.&lt;br />There is so much tension that any humor spills out suddenly in a rush, providing a welcome release.&lt;br />In our case, another family\u2019s daily and nightly watch had coincided with ours. Scooter, being the friendly half of our duo, had gotten to know their story.&lt;br />Their ICU patient was only about 50 years old and his future time on this Earth was tenuous. They were holding up well, though. The patient\u2019s wife, his 20-something son, his sister in-law and a few other relatives or friends were there every day.&lt;br />They\u2019d mostly sit and chat among themselves about family doings, or what the cafeteria down the hall was serving for lunch or other innocuous matters.&lt;br />One day a preacher showed up. They weren\u2019t on a first-name basis with the man, so they must not have been active church-goers, but he introduced himself with a smile after he made his entrance.&lt;br />The wife of the ICU patients spoke up and met the preacher, who then turned to the woman beside her and said, \u201cAnd you must be the mom.\u201d&lt;br />There were blank looks all around until the woman said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m her sister.\u201d&lt;br />There was a second or two of uneasy silence until the son of the ICU patient, who was seated on the other side of the room, put his hand over his mouth to stifle a guffaw.&lt;br />Then he turned to shoot Scooter a wide-eyed look of \u201cOhmygosh!\u201d&lt;br />Scooter, who was undergoing her own massive dosage of stress due to my father\u2019s illness, saw the son\u2019s reaction, then burst out in a laugh before she was able to put her own hand over her mouth.&lt;br />Then everyone else chuckled.&lt;br />The preacher apologized, said he was praying for the patient and then he left.&lt;br />Then the entire room burst out into loud laughter.&lt;br />The gray-haired woman who was mistaken for her sister\u2019s mother said she guessed she\u2019d have to start tinting her hair again.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019ve had every color there is,\u201d she observed dryly.&lt;br />The case of mistaken identity was good for everyone, taking our minds off the life-and-death matters at hand. The gray-haired lady obviously did not mind the humor coming at her expense.&lt;br />The next day, my dad was transferred to another hospital. I walked beside him as his stretcher was wheeled out. I knew that family was watching me as I followed Dad out to the ambulance, but I didn\u2019t look their way.&lt;br />I heard them say \u201cgood luck.\u201d&lt;br />I don\u2019t know if their patient made it out of the ICU alive but I hope he did, and so far, my 80-year-old dad, who\u2019s never spent more than a few hours in a hospital in his entire life, is still with us.&lt;br />posted by Banjo Jones 3:22 PM &lt;br />9.14.2001 &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />A poem for these times&lt;br />&lt;br />\"There is sobbing of the strong,&lt;br />And a pall upon the land;&lt;br />But the People in their weeping&lt;br />Bare the iron hand;&lt;br />Beware the People weeping&lt;br />When they bare the iron hand.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />- Herman Melville, \"The Martyr,\" upon the death of Abraham&lt;br />Lincoln.&lt;br />posted by Banjo Jones 10:00 PM &lt;br />&lt;br />9.13.2001 &lt;br />&lt;br />Come together&lt;br />&lt;br />There is a rally/prayer service at 7:30 p.m. Friday at the Lake Jackson Civic Center where all of us can show our support for our country, the president and the people who were murdered in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on Tuesday.&lt;br />We don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a Christian, a Moslem, an atheist or an anarchist, this is your chance to show that you care.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />posted by Banjo Jones 1:54 PM &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />After the attack, remembering a victim&lt;br />&lt;br />Yesterday, Scooter went out to the garage and found our American flag, which she\u2019s had since the nation celebrated its Bicentennial in 1976.&lt;br />She unfurled it and went out to the front yard to stick it in one of our big planters, where we try to grow roses. &lt;br />By the end of the day, three more of our neighbors were flying their flags. Others in other neighborhoods around town were flying theirs, too.&lt;br />She\u2019s also said she\u2019s going to send back her $300 federal tax cut money with a note telling whoever\u2019s in charge of such matters to use the money to help someone affected by the terrorist attack on Tuesday.&lt;br />She\u2019s too old to enlist in the Army. Otherwise, she\u2019d probably be filling out an application as I write this.&lt;br />You feel powerless in the face of such events. You watch it on TV, read about it on the Internet and in the newspapers, talk to your friends about it and not much else.&lt;br />Scooter told me this morning she knows one of the victims in the World Trade Center attack.&lt;br />His name was Chris Jeffreys. She went to his wedding about 14 years ago.&lt;br />\u201cHe was a poor boy from Michigan who became very rich and wealthy, moved to New York City and expanded his empire,\u201d she said. \u201cHe bought homes on the East and West Coast, apartments in Manhattan and mansions in the Hamptons, flats in London and villas in the South of France. As a person he was just real down to earth. He never forgot where he was from. He enjoyed showing his friends the good life he had acquired and he enjoyed sharing everything with his friends. He was very, very generous. Very generous. He would invite you to Deer Valley (Utah) and wouldn\u2019t let you spend a dime. His daughter\u2019s 13th birthday party was on a yacht in New York Harbor. He\u2019d send you an airline ticket and an invitation and put you up at The Plaza. Donald Trump was at his wedding. He was just a very kind and generous person.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019m just still kind of numb about it. I just keep thinking about his daughter. He adored her. Just adored her. You can\u2019t imagine. She\u2019s probably 26 now. If anyone made the most out of life, Chris did.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cHe was from a no advantage type of background. He worked his way through Michigan law school. His dad was some kind of steelworker. He didn\u2019t go to law school to practice law. He went to law school to find out how to manuever through the business world and to get out of where he was and on to a better life. He was just driven, really driven. That comes from being poor.\u201d&lt;br />Now this generous man who exemplifies the best part of the American Dream is gone, along with thousands of others.&lt;br />Scooter\u2019s mother called last night to report she was having lunch at her government office when she overheard some coworkers, who were ardent, outspoken supporters of Al Gore in the last election.&lt;br />She said she overheard them talking while they watched the news on television.&lt;br />\u201cThank God this is the group that was in charge of the Gulf War,\u201d she quoted them as saying.&lt;br />Scooter\u2019s mom, a gung ho Republican, said she bit her tongue.&lt;br />posted by Banjo Jones 10:26 AM &lt;br />9.11.2001 &lt;br />&lt;br />Close to home&lt;br />&lt;br />I heard the news of the World Trade Center on the radio, in my car.&lt;br />It wasn\u2019t until a few hours later that I saw the TV pictures.&lt;br />The airliner crashing into the skyscraper looked like some kind of video game. Not real at all. Just an image on a screen.&lt;br />You half expected the TV screen to flash Game Over, then resume with a new video image of an intact World Trade Center, before the image of the airliner would re-appear and head for the tall building again.&lt;br />If only it worked that way. If only you could take a joystick, make a few quick manuevers, push a few buttons, and save the world.&lt;br />Then I remembered.&lt;br />I HAVE A NIECE WHO LIVES IN MANHATTAN. &lt;br />I called my sister to see if she\u2019s heard anything from Kelley, her daughter, who\u2019s a student at New York University.&lt;br />I got her answering machine.&lt;br />Scooter already had talked to my mother, who said my sister couldn\u2019t find a map of New York City. She remembered the street where Kelley lives, but she needed a map to figure out how close it might be to the World Trade Center.&lt;br />But Scooter remembered. She remembered Kelley was living on Water Street. And she\u2019s been to New York City enough to know that Water Street is real close to the World Trade Center.&lt;br />Several hours went by. No word from my sister. I took a nap. Scooter stayed glued to the TV.&lt;br />Then, a few minutes ago, my sister called.&lt;br />Her daughter, Kelley, a sophomore at NYU, was alright.&lt;br />She said she was riding the shuttle bus to class this morning when she noticed some papers flying around in the air.&lt;br />She thought it odd.&lt;br />Then she looked up and saw the second explosion.&lt;br />My sister started crying when she told me her daughter was unharmed.&lt;br />As for Kelley, she went on to class after witnessing the explosion. Her dormitory, five blocks from the World Trade Center, is closed.&lt;br />The ATM she uses is right across the street from the World Trade Center.&lt;br />\u201cShe could have been there,\u201d my sister said, breaking up.&lt;br />Yes, she could have, but she wasn\u2019t, and for that I am grateful.&lt;br />posted by Banjo Jones 4:28 PM &lt;br />9.9.2001 &lt;br />&lt;br />POLITICS&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />back scratchin'&lt;br />&lt;br />If you were watching the Astros game on the tube last weekend like we were, you may have noticed two familiar faces sitting in the $200 seats directly behind home plate, where Astros owner Drayton McLane sits.&lt;br />It was our state Sen. Buster Brown and Judge Ben Hardin.&lt;br />Whenever the camera from centerfield panned the batter's box, you could see the two of them enjoying our National Pasttime.&lt;br />We don't who was paying for the Cokes and popcorn, but it wouldn't surprise us if the judge was paying the freight.&lt;br />Sen. Buster got George W. Bush, who was governor at the time, to appoint him to the job after Neil Caldwell retired to his fingerpaints back in '95.&lt;br />Anyhow, a number of people thought someone else should have been appointed to the judicial vacancy, someone of more judicial depth and experience than Ben Hardin.&lt;br />Sen. Buster didn't see it that way, and since he's the politico who holds sway around here, that's what counts.&lt;br />Which is why Sen. Buster, by coincidence we're sure, gets appointed by Judge Hardin to lend his expert mediation services to all those cases in the 23rd Judicial District.&lt;br />&lt;br />dude, where's my raise?&lt;br />&lt;br />The politician with the coolest name in Texas, Prct. 1 County Commissioner Dude Payne, has laid claim to the Populist of the Year trophy by virtue of his stance on a pay raise for himself.&lt;br />\"I knew what this job paid when I ran for it,\" Dude was quoted as saying when he pooh-poohed the idea of hiking pay for the county's elected officials.&lt;br />That's very Gary Cooperesque.&lt;br />Or John Waynesque, if you prefer.&lt;br />We have a hard time picturing his predecessor opining such a notion to the media unless he was talking about the price of the grilled cheese sandwiches down at the county airport's lunch counter.&lt;br />Could it be that the man called Dude will surpass Ronnie Broaddus as a bonafide man of the people?&lt;br />Despite his obvious shortcomings, which were well documented in the files of the DA's office, Broaddus cut a wide swath when he would pull such stunts as marching to the courthouse toting a picket sign that bashed his favorite whipping boy, Dow Chemical.&lt;br />Such antics don't fit Dude's job description, but if he keeps dishing out those heaping helpings of Humble Pie, he will be a fixture at the courthouse for a long time.&lt;br />&lt;br />\"me no Alamo\"&lt;br />&lt;br />The Democrats and the Republicans are stumbling over themselves to become one with their brown brothers and sisters.&lt;br />The Dems have found a rich Hispanic to run for governor and now the Rs are angling to get an Hispanic congressman appointed U.S. Senator.&lt;br />It's the new Millenium's answer to Nixon's Southern Strategy in the late '60s, when Tricky Dick turned the Democrats on their heads by wooing Dixiecrat voters away from the party of FDR.&lt;br />Back then, Nixon appealed to a Silent Majority.&lt;br />The new Silent Majority are Hispanics.&lt;br />You don't hear a politician promising a chicken in every pot any more, but you may hear one promising frijoles in every microwave in the coming years.&lt;br />At least one politician says Texans will never elect an Hispanic to the governor's office.&lt;br />That man is John Worldpeace, a Houston lawyer running for governor who routinely refers to Gov. Rick Perry as \"the Republican devil Rick Perry.\"&lt;br />Native Texan white voters over 50 years of age are too prejuduiced to vote for an Hispanic as governor principally due to racism that dates back to the massacres at Goliad and the Alamo, says Worldpeace.&lt;br />That\u2019s a politically incorrect statement, of course, even from a crackpot, but the leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties in our state have shown that whatever truth may lie in that sentiment is no longer politically viable.&lt;br />posted by Banjo Jones 1:00 AM &lt;br />9.1.2001 &lt;br />&lt;br />The Vigil&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />Michael was 13 when he was hit by the car.&lt;br />His father called Scooter from the hospital and told her that his son was going to die.&lt;br />He was running across a freeway when he was hit. The impact knocked him out of his shoes, crushed his body.&lt;br />Michael was still in his bloody clothes when Scooter got to the hospital.&lt;br />He was in a deep, deep coma and not expected to live.&lt;br />That\u2019s when the vigil began.&lt;br />Scooter\u2019s memories of that horrible time were evoked when we recently heard that the young boy in Florida who had been attacked by a shark had been sent home while he was still in a coma.&lt;br />When Michael was hit by the car, the family was still grieving over a tragedy that occurred 12 years earlier. Michael\u2019s sister Little Tia, only 2 years old at the time, was killed when she fell out of the car after the door came open.&lt;br />Now it appeared likely Michael would join his sister.&lt;br />After the first two days, when he surprised the doctors by surviving, they fixed his leg, inserting pins to mend it.&lt;br />But the only way he could breathe was on a ventilator, and there were no signs that he would soon rejoin the world as a conscious human being.&lt;br />The Tribe, as Scooter\u2019s family calls themselves, stayed by his bed, arriving and leaving in shifts, but the doctor offered no encouragement that he would regain consciousness.&lt;br />\u201cYou\u2019d lift up his eyes and it was like no one was there,\u201d Scooter remembers.&lt;br />But every day, Scooter made the 45-minute drive to the hospital. She didn\u2019t give the least intimation to her nephew that his situation was grave.&lt;br />\u201cHi, Michael! It\u2019s Scooter. How\u2019re you today?\u201d she\u2019d say upon entering his hospital room.&lt;br />He didn\u2019t respond, of course, but the greeting stayed the same.&lt;br />The doctors said he couldn\u2019t hear her, but Scooter decided from the beginning that he could hear every word she spoke.&lt;br />She read books to him like the The Power of Positive Thinking, Creative Visualization and the Bible.&lt;br />She talked to him about what he would do when he woke up, how he was going to ride his bike and play baseball. &lt;br />When there was a ball game on the TV, she\u2019d watch and give him a play-by-play account.&lt;br />After a while, Scooter\u2019s Significant Other at that time told her to quit going to the hospital, it was a waste of time. But she went anyway, every day, as soon as he left the house. She just didn\u2019t tell him.&lt;br />Early in the vigil, Scooter called a close friend named Ed Foreman, a former Congressman from New Mexico who now is a motivational speaker. He was on vacation when she called, but his office tracked him down.&lt;br />He made a tape recording for Michael that Scooter played every day. She told the nurse to turn the tape over if she wasn\u2019t there so her nephew could hear both sides.&lt;br />On the tape, Ed Foreman talked to Michael as if he was sitting in the room with him.&lt;br />\u201cMichael, this is your friend Ed Foreman...\u201d&lt;br />Michael had never met Ed Foreman but Ed talked to him as if they were old friends. He talked to Michael about comas and the unconscious mind. He told him he was going through a challenging time, that his body was healing.&lt;br />He told him that one day he would laugh out loud and people would enjoy being in his company.&lt;br />He told him to breathe deep.&lt;br />From outward appearances, there was no discernible way to tell if Michael was absorbing any of it. At least that\u2019s what the doctors said.&lt;br />But Scooter kept talking and reading, and the Ed Foreman tape kept rolling.&lt;br />The doctors weren\u2019t impressed.&lt;br />One day Scooter walked into the room and Michael\u2019s eyes were open.&lt;br />The doctor said it was involuntary.&lt;br />By then, Michael\u2019s arms and hands had begun to curl up. His muscles had begun to atrophy. A physical therapist showed Scooter how to get his hands open and pull his arms down. That alone took two weeks to accomplish.&lt;br />Though the doctors initially attributed no significance to Michael\u2019s eyes being open, a few weeks later, Scooter said she could see something she hadn\u2019t seen in the beginning.&lt;br />She could tell somebody was in there.&lt;br />\u201cInvoluntary tracking,\u201d the doctor said.&lt;br />Then one afternoon a Daffy Duck cartoon was on TV and Scooter could tell he was watching it.&lt;br />\u201cInvoluntary tracking,\u201d the doctor said.&lt;br />Six months passed.&lt;br />He was still on a ventilator. The doctors told Scooter and the rest of The Tribe they need to think about placing Michael in a nursing home.&lt;br />\u201cMaybe some day he\u2019ll be able to feed himself,\u201d the doc said.&lt;br />The Tribe argued against the move. They didn\u2019t want to surrender.&lt;br />Then, just before he was to be transferred to a nursing home, Michael caught a cold. He couldn\u2019t be transferred while he was sick. It was like a reprieve from the governor for a condemned man, and it gave Scooter and Co. more time to plead their case. &lt;br />They wanted Michael put in the hospital\u2019s coma unit, instead of a nursing home, but the doctor said he hadn\u2019t shown enough progress.&lt;br />Michael could blink his eyes and squeeze a visitor\u2019s hand, but the doctor said it was meaningless.&lt;br />But Scooter was so persistent, as only Scooter can be, and the doctor finally relented, with one proviso. Michael had to demonstrate he could obey a certain command.&lt;br />\u201cIf you can make him stick out his tongue, we\u2019ll put him in the coma unit,\u201d he said.&lt;br />Finally, an opening!&lt;br />For the next two weeks, Scooter went to Michael\u2019s room with a different greeting.&lt;br />\u201cHi, Michael, it\u2019s your Aunt Scooter. Give me your tongue.\u201d&lt;br />She\u2019d pull his tongue out of his mouth.&lt;br />\u201cOK, now it\u2019s out,\u201d she\u2019d say.&lt;br />Then she\u2019d push it back in.&lt;br />\u201cOK, now it\u2019s back in.\u201d&lt;br />Again and again. Every day for two weeks.&lt;br />When deadline day arrived, The Tribe was besides themselves. Sometimes Michael would stick his tongue out and sometimes he wouldn\u2019t.&lt;br />It was time to do it for the doctor.&lt;br />When the man in the white coat arrived, Scooter said, \u201cOK, Michael, stick out your tongue.\u201d&lt;br />Nothing.&lt;br />\u201cMichael, stick out your tongue.\u201d&lt;br />Nothing.&lt;br />\u201cMichael, stick...\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSee? Nursing home,\u201d the doctor said.&lt;br />The doctor, a voice of authoritative pessimism every day for the last six months, turned to walk out of the room.&lt;br />As he was about to go through the door, Michael, like a 6-year-old making a face as soon as his playground nemesis turns his back, stuck out his tongue.&lt;br />\u201cSee! See! He stuck out his tongue! He stuck out his tongue!\u201d&lt;br />The doctor stopped. With a sigh, he turned around.&lt;br />\u201cLet me see it again.\u201d&lt;br />And Michael stuck his tongue out in the doctor\u2019s face, as if to say, \u201cTHERE! SEE?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cOK,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cComa unit.\u201d&lt;br />Everyone in the room cried, everyone except the doctor and Michael.&lt;br />In the coma unit, Michael\u2019s tracheotomy tube was removed. The nurses warned The Tribe not to be surprised if his speech sounded infantile because his brain injury may have reduced his intellectual level.&lt;br />Scooter asked Michael if he wanted to listen to music.&lt;br />He nodded yes.&lt;br />\u201cFat Boys,\u201d he croaked.&lt;br />His request for rap music proved, in Scooter\u2019s mind, that he was still operating at his correct age level -- a 13-year-old boy.&lt;br />Scooter rushed out of the room and found a Fat Boys tape.&lt;br />The next words Michael uttered proved something else.&lt;br />\u201cWho\u2019s Ed Foreman?\u201d he asked.&lt;br />\u201cI just started balling,\u201d Scooter remembers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d&lt;br />Michael had been in a coma for seven months.&lt;br />For seven months, he had a tube down his throat and an Ed Foreman tape playing on headphones. For seven months he had nurses poking him with their fingers and with needles to see if he would respond.&lt;br />For seven months, Scooter had caressed his arms every day, to let him know that she and the rest of The Tribe were waiting for him.&lt;br />Michael put his hand on aunt\u2019s hand. \u201cI love you Aunt Scooter,\u201d he said.&lt;br />He spent the next four months working on his speech and motor development. He had to learn how to walk again..&lt;br />\u201cIt\u2019s inch by inch. Each day is another inch, a little bit more,\u201d Scooter recalls.&lt;br />She brought him hamburgers and milkshakes from McDonald\u2019s.&lt;br />One day, Scooter asked him, \u201cWhere were you, Michael?\u201d&lt;br />He told her he was with God.&lt;br />Michael said, \u201cHe told me I didn\u2019t have to come back if I didn\u2019t want to. I had to think about it and then I decided to come back.\u201d&lt;br />Michael said this matter-of-factly, and Scooter took it matter-of-factly.&lt;br />For the next six months, Michael used a walker to get around. He used it to walk to the podium to address his junior high graduation class.&lt;br />Today he wears a brace on his leg.&lt;br />It\u2019s the only visible reminder of his accident. He\u2019s a good-looking young man, dark brown hair, dark moustache. He is 23 years old and has a hearty laugh. He has been working at McDonald\u2019s the last couple years and has been named Employee of the Month three times.&lt;br />He\u2019d rather work and be around people than stay at home, even though it put a stop to his disability benefits.&lt;br />People enjoy his company, just like Ed Foreman told him they would on that tape recording he listened to a long time ago.&lt;br />posted by Banjo Jones 10:33 PM"},

But then &lt;a href=\"http://myfavoriteanathenaeum.blogspot.com/2005/03/please-stop-terri-schiavos-suffering.html\">Voracious Reader&lt;/a> joined the clamour and, as it were, invited my response. In failing to check myself, I admit I fall prey to that base, nearly universal impulse to prove one of my father's favorite maxims, namely, that opinions are like a---holes: everybody's got one.&lt;br />&lt;br />As a preliminary matter, I should like the score to reflect another victory for my notion that the judiciary remains a largely non-political organ against the efforts of laymen and news media to reduce it to a product of judges' personal whims and politics. If you'll recall, as soon as the Congress passed the act giving jurisdiction to the Western District of Florida, the networks and papers al began to speculate intensely about how \"conservative\" or \"liberal\" judges on that district were, as though that issue would somehow be determinative of whether the parents would get their TRO. As it happened, the media's speculation seemed to be borne out in the district court, since the case was assigned to a Clinton appointee who denied the petitions. Encouraged by this succes, Fox News, if memory serves, began to speculate about the ideological composition of the 11th Circuit, noting that they were largely Republican appointees, and quoting some professor from Western South Central Florida Snobby-Eater College of Law and Brake Tuning, or some such, who driveled \"if you get two Republicans on the panel, this gets overturned in a heartbeat.\" As it tuned out, the literal truth of his statement was never put to the test, since the panel comprised two Democrats and a Republican; but the Republican joined the majority that upheld the denial, and it was a Democrat who dissented. Moreover, on the motion for rehearing &lt;em>en banc&lt;/em>, only two of the dozen judges voted to grant, meaning that at most one Republican on the entire court disagreed particularly strongly with the district court's ruling.&lt;br />&lt;br />To top it all off, not one of the justices on the Supreme Court even wrote to disagree with the refusal to award emergency relief--not even Justice Scalia, whom the ignorant commonly regard as a tool of Papists and religious conservatives. Indeed, I think Scalia would be the first to recognize what everyone with a decent grasp of federal jurisprudence, regardless of their stake in the result, realized the minute they read the Congress's emergency legislation: there isn't even the shadow of a substantive claim under federal law. Nor, in any circumstance other than this one, would any sensible conservative want there to be. For example, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/mccarthy/mccarthy200503250823.asp\">Andrew McCarthy&lt;/a> groans on about how the Constitution requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt in \"death cases.\" I expect he would, however, be on of the first to come forward in defense of the ability (established in &lt;em>Kansas v. Hendricks&lt;/em>) of authorities to prove by clear and convincing evidence the psychological propensity of someone to commit sex crimes and lock him up indefinitely under a civil commitment statute, though the right to liberty is protected by the Constitution in the same breath with the right to life. \"How,\" you say, \"can one compare the rights of a sex offender with those of an innocent?\" But the law is blind to such distinctions, as it should be. The only recourse would be to alter the standard of proof somewhere in substantive law (although I've never heard of ratcheting it up in a civil case to proof beyond a reasonable doubt). And such an alteration would probably not even be supported by the people, since I doubt many people relish &lt;em>ex ante&lt;/em> the thought of being preserved in a ghoulish state of half-death.&lt;br />&lt;br />I'm not quite sure why it is that I seem to agree with nearly everything &lt;a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/buckley/wfb200503231118.asp\">William F. Buckley says&lt;/a>--even when I would expect him to disagree with me. In particular, I agree with his point that it is analytically unsound to equate affirmative refusal to preserve life with killing. Such a notion, with its sweeping implications for the moral necessity of a welfare state, is more commonly held by the most pinko socialist than the libertarian or institutional conservative. And yet it is precisely what all the rhetoric from the \"right to life\" culture postulates. This controversy has illustrated a point that went unnoticed in the past several years of Republican ascendancy, namely, that there is little or no inherent ideological union between limited-government conservatism and Christian social conservatism--it is largely a marriage of convenience. The most irksome thing to me about his whole affair is the toll that it may take on the integrity of Republican politics as the party struggles to keep fundamentalists in the fold. Whether we like it or not, Bill Rhenquist is going to be retiring this year, and it's going to be a long row to hoe getting someone to replace him to the right of David Souter unless Democratic obstructionism is overcome. This debacle could provide the perfect sort of ammunition for Democrats to lob, saying that all the Republicans' talk of \"judicial activism\" is merely a euphemism for judges who come to substantive conclusions that the religious right doesn't like. I also shudder to think that their loss in this case will ignite religious conservatives to try harder to appoint people for their moral rather than legal views; my blood curdles at the thought of a judge who would have granted a stay in this case because he thought it is what Jesus would have done. On the other hand, for the moment, I cannot fault, for example, W's willingness to sign the bill and utter a few platitudes. As a reassurance that our president is in his heart of hearts a true conservative, I was actually pleased to hear that Bush had been sensible enough to sign that law in Texas. It's dreadful to think of people being vegetables on the public nickel. But though I, as an irreligious structural conservative, might prefer if the Republican party were in a position to discard the useful idiots of the religious right like yesterday's linen, we cannot afford the luxury right now, with socialism attracting hordes of its own fanatics. Nevertheless we must remember that, when push comes to shove, there is nothing special impelling religious fundamentalists to prefer the rule of law and limited government if it conflicts with their religious notions.&lt;br />&lt;br />So, then, in conclusion I would cordially disagree with Voracious Reader when she says that concerns of federalism should be subordinated to those of \"life and death.\" Our system of government has been a bulwark to liberty against political storms and the tyrrany of men for hundreds of years; millions of people far better than the thing that lies expiring in a hospice in Pinellas County have died to build and preserve it. The rule of law is not better than the rule of man because it always produces results that we like: it is better because it is the law, impartial and unyielding. I, for one, will raise a glass when the political fuss dies down, and what was once Theresa Marie Schindler Schiavo is finally allowed to finish the death it began fifteen years ago."},

Perhaps nowhere else in the world does the ancient order meet the modern with more dramatic impact. Huddled among million dollar industries--shipping, oil, spices, foodstocks, mining and skills--lies a kind of \"no man's land\" into which most of the non-white classes are crammed. Here, in one of the most densely populated regions of the world, thousands of human beings from every corner of the world live in surroundings that defy description.&lt;br />&lt;br />Here exotic women and mysterious men of every sort intermingle. Here peddlers, dancers, wandering musicians, beggars, soldiers of fortune, merchants, thieves, prostitutes, bakers, candlestick makers and drug addicts rub elbows. Here for western consumption, is embodied all the strange and titillating allure of the exotic Middle East.&lt;br />&lt;br />Port Said is a place in which every individual can find something to suit his or her taste. It doesn't matter what one's favorite pastime or personal idea of pleasure may be. There are open markets where one can buy--or be fleeced--almost anything one wishes from soda pop to an oriental dagger or opium pipe. There are dancing girls who will perform their ancient ritual for a few modest coins (and for a little more will take you into their tent or hut for more enjoyable entertainment). An endless parade of native women fills the streets as they go to and from the market or home carrying urns, woven blankets or other burdens on their heads.&lt;br />&lt;br />Almost at every turn there is a pottery merchant who piles his wares to all who cross his spot in the open street. Every now and then the wind wafts the familiar smell of the harbor through the crowded streets, reminding one that Port Said stands at the entrance to the Suez Canal, through which pours an endless caravan of vessels from all over the world. Occasionally you see a camel alongside a streamlined automobile, one of the most striking reminders that co-existence of the old and the new is still very real.&lt;br />&lt;br />And through it all runs the pattern of music, a fascinating and distinctive variety of primitive instruments and equally primitive forms of vocal expression. Compared with western music, modern Egyptian music has changed little from the music of the ancient world. There is a good deal of repetition, but this is one of the elements that makes Egyptian music somewhat ritualistic, and much more interesting to listen to. Even today, for the most part, no fixed harmony or notation is used. The scale is a quarter tone, rather than the western diatonic half tone, scale.&lt;br />&lt;br />Like ancient Egyptian music, the modern variety makes much use of a large variety of instruments, including drums, flutes, bells, cymbals, castanets, clarinets, oboes and strings. Also, a considerable number of different kinds of percussion sticks are used to accompany the music and singing.&lt;br />&lt;br />The music in this recording, typical of authentic Egyptian style, is the kind you will hear in every native setting, either with or without dancing. Some of it harks back to the ancient slave market, when maidens performed sensuous and provocative dances to the accompaniment of native bands of musicians. It is untamed and raw, but orthodox.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the main, Egyptian music is always dance music. It is usually lively, even though it may be sad in mood. Countless generations, through joy and suffering, have contributed to the musical art of this land. The earthiness of dancing girl and beggar breathe with equal eloquence and power in the music you hear in Port Said, for time has passed without essentially changing these simple hearts who live their lives with dance and song.\" -- el-bakkar website"},

I suppose you\u2019ve all been wondering what exactly happened neigh on four months ago that has kept me from completing a relevant, enjoyable-to-read post of any significant length. I will also suppose that you will not accept some flimsy tale of mild computer problems and laziness. I suppose that you will settle for nothing less than the completely true, white-knuckle action spectacular tale of how I wound up like I am today: computerless, hairless, and aching both physically and emotionally. In that case, listen up, readers, for I will now a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, thy knotted and combined locks to part, and each particular hair to stand on end, like the quills upon the fretful porpentine, as the poet says.&lt;br />&lt;br />Let\u2019s see . . .. Where to begin . . .. I guess it all started back in the early days of the Thanksgiving vacation. Sam and I were traveling home from the mall after some Christmas shopping. It was about nine o\u2019 clock at night and . . ..&lt;br />&lt;br />The late autumn moon hung low and ominous over the canals of Holyoke as the two Sugrue brothers drove along the back roads of the old factory district. Weak halogen streetlights dimly revealed the crumbling brick facades of some of the city\u2019s oldest buildings. Richard, the elder brother, slowed the maroon Oldsmobile to a sluggish 55 miles per hour.&lt;br />\u201cSam,\u201d he whispered urgently, \u201cDoes anything about that building seem strange to you?\u201d Richard pointed to a particularly large and imposing architectural monstrosity across the canal.&lt;br />\u201cWell, it could be the oddly thriving vines covering the face of the structure, despite the cold. Maybe it\u2019s the new locks on the bridge gate, despite the fact that the building itself looks abandoned. Or it could be the swarms of guards surrounding the perimeter. Lastly, it might just be the giant red and white Umbrella Corporation logo on the gates, the roof, the vehicles, and the guards themselves, you stupid fucking chink.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cJeezum Crowe! You might be onto something there, amigo.\u201d Richard muttered thoughtfully, bringing the car to a stop 50 feet down the street from the gates. \u201cIf that is the Umbrella Corporation, I don\u2019t like them being that close. It spells trouble.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSo you\u2019re stopping across the canal from their stronghold because you\u2019re worried about them being close? Shouldn\u2019t we be getting as far away as possible?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cListen, monkey fuck,\u201d Richard said vehemently, \u201cthese bastards have tried to kill me on no less than three separate occasions. They\u2019ve also tried to kill my friends. Normally that would be enough for me to want revenge, but on top of that they threaten the fabric of global society with their never-ending nonsensical and oft-times flammable machinations. They are constantly attempting to raise the dead, corrupt the youth of the world, and they create monstrous abominations which maim and kill all in their path.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSo?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell, granted I admire them for all of those reasons, but keep in mind that they are mostly staffed by pretentious Euro-trash in Armani suits and they test their products on animals.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThose villains!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSo I figure, if they\u2019re always planning, why not do some eavesdropping and see what they\u2019re up to. That way we\u2019ll be ready the next time they strike. And, as an added incentive we might be able to pull some pre-emptive ass kicking.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cHmm . . . alright, let\u2019s do it!\u201d Sam assented with gusto.&lt;br />The two boys quietly stepped out of the car and crept quickly over to the towering chain-link fence separating them from the steep drop to the murky canal below. Hiding from the yellowed glow of the streetlights, they moved stealthily down the road until they stood before the imposing wrought-iron gates that closed off the bridge. Rich shuddered. The gates were large and formidable and emanated antiquity. Rusted and covered with thick, clinging ivy, they filled him with a substantial amount of dread.&lt;br />\u201cAnd how are we supposed to get in, fuck squat?\u201d Sam inquired.&lt;br />Rich soundlessly knelt in front of the locked gates and took a small leather case from his pocket. He slipped out three metal instruments: lock picks.&lt;br />\u201cThis\u2019ll just be a second.\u201d Rich said. \u201cWait. You don\u2019t happen to have a key, do you?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNo.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cJust checking.\u201d&lt;br />Richard expertly manipulated the skinny tools inside the heavy padlock on the gates. After a few minutes of twisting and poking, Rich was reward by a loud click, and the doors swung open a few inches.&lt;br />\u201cWell done,\u201d Sam said. \u201cHow\u2019d you learn how to do that?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI dated a hot cat burglar.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI think you mean you bought a lock-picking set out of a cheap army surplus catalog and it came with an instructional pamphlet.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cMaybe so . . .. Well, let\u2019s get down to the reconnaissance, amigo. And proceed with caution.\u201d&lt;br />They slipped through the gates and crept through the shadows across the bridge to old factory building, careful to avoid the security staff prowling purposefully about.&lt;br />Richard was surprised to see that the normally flamboyant and exotic Umbrella Corporation was employing human guards. Especially dangerous looking human guards. Moreover, the various workers bustling about the complex seemed uncharacteristically efficient. Something was going on in the Umbrella Corporation. Something big.&lt;br />&lt;br />The factory was much larger than it had appeared from the road. It was part of an expansive complex that contained several adjacent buildings nearly the size of the main structure. The immensity of the operation struck Richard as decidedly sinister. It did not bode well. He decided to tell Sam this, but found that his brother had sneaked off to steal obscure pieces of equipment. Figuring his brother could take care of himself, Richard headed for the main building. He crept around to the side, avoiding the shadow of the formidable front doors. He found an iron ladder attached to the building near the back. Richard climbed four stories to the roof without hesitation, and, using muscles built up from years of roofing, made his way to one of the larger skylights. Wiping some soot and grime from a pane of glass, he peered through at the scene below.&lt;br />He was looking down at a large, darkened room. Taking prominence in the center of the room was a massive black meeting table. There were ten people on each side of it, and one person at each end. The figures along the sides were dressed impeccably in dark suits. Their features were indistinct, their faces shrouded in darkness, but Richard could tell that there was an even distribution of men and women. The ends of the table were slightly illuminated, and he could make out the two figures at each. At one end was a large, solidly built man in a coal black suit. His dark, rugged race was creased in a frown. His dark eyes were peering steadily across the table to the far end. His thick, dark hands lay motionless on the ebony surface in front of him. He was, in short, a dark character. The one part of his person that was not dark was his tie. It was a most remarkable tie, white in the background, with vibrant red and yellow geometric patterns. The remarkable thing was that the shapes were in constant movement, shifting across the fabric in hypnotic swirls. Richard then realized why this dark character was visible when everyone else in the room (save the figure at the other end of the table) was hidden in shadow. The tie gave off its own light. Richard then turned his attention to the figure at the other end of the table and his jaw dropped. Surrounded by a circle of light that shone down from above stood a creature that had haunted his dreams for months. Towering above the two guards on either side of him, his mechanical limbs gleaming in the light, was Captain Adolph Lenin Huzuki-bot 3500.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cHoly fuck!\u201d&lt;br />Richard looked up quickly. Sam had returned from his larcenous endeavors and made his way to the roof. He was now looking through the same skylight as his brother.&lt;br />\u201cThat\u2019s the Captain, isn\u2019t it, Rich?\u201d asked Sam in numb disbelief.&lt;br />\u201cIt is. And that dark character at the other end of the table is Mr. Hazzard, if I\u2019m not mistaken. He was in my Sociology book. He\u2019s a corporate lawyer, employed by the Umbrella Corporation it seems. I wonder what\u2019s going on.\u201d&lt;br />The brothers stopped speaking and turned their attention back to the window the below.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cCaptain Adolph Lenin Huzuki-bot 3500,\u201d spoke Mr. Hazzard in a rumbling basso which all black people have *cough Underworld cough* \u201cYou have been summoned before us, the Umbrella Corporation board of directors, because you have failed to execute your duties on three separate occasions. Your ineffective management skills have cost UC millions and set back our plans for several years. Moreover, you have not made any significant gains through your subsidiary company, Ninja Pirate Incorporated. As that enterprise is owned by the Umbrella Corporation, we expect profits on our investments. You have proven an ineffective leader, a failure, and a financial liability.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cIn short, you\u2019ve outlived your usefulness.\u201d&lt;br />These words were not spoken by anyone physically in attendance at the meeting. A mammoth screen behind Hazzard suddenly lit up and a face appeared on it, dominating the entire room. The face was that of a man, Richard could tell that much by the goatee. But its features were fine and effeminate, giving it an androgynous appearance. The man was old, but healthy looking. A pair of pince nez glasses, which were perched upon his aquiline nose, hid his eyes. The lenses of these were an octagonal pattern made up of red and white stained glass triangles. They were the logo of the Umbrella Corporation. He was clad in a blood red suit, with a black shirt and white ascot. His hair was silver and short-cropped. Richard had no idea who he was.&lt;br />\u201cCaptain, you cost more than you\u2019re worth.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYarr,\u201d interjected the Captain, \u201cZince ven has the \u2018Brella Corperation been about efficiency?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019ll admit that the past corporate strategy has been lacking in direction and logic, but for various reasons we have undertaken to establish new policies and become a more effective entity.\u201d He paused here for effect. \u201cYour failure to eliminate the threat posed by those meddlesome students has not impressed me to any extent. I have run out of patience.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cAn\u2019 another thing, vy does we have ter keel zose poor students? They were creary fighting in self defense.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to mind being appointed this task before.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI were only forrowing orders.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYour kindness has no place here. You, Captain, are officially demoted. Henceforth you and your division will be under the supervision of a personally picked high enforcer. Gentlemen,\u201d he said, turning his attention to the council, \u201callow me to introduce the newest member of the Umbrella Corporation team, vice president Silas Blake.\u201d&lt;br />A pair of automated sliding doors hissed open, filling the darkened hall with white light, and a figure stepped forth. It was a boy of no more than 19, Richard guessed. Of average height and built, he seemed remarkably unassuming. Blake made his way into the room and stood next to the Captain. The doors he entered through slid closed and another beam of light, like that surrounding the Captain, shone down done upon him, so Richard could make him out clearly. He had tussled brown hair and boyish good looks. He peered confidently, a little smugly even, at the assembled council, through mysterious turquoise eyes.&lt;br />\u201cGlad to be here, Doc,\u201d he said as he gave the giant omnipresent head on the screen a jaunty salute.&lt;br />&lt;br />On the roof, Sam laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s just a kid!\u201d&lt;br />Richard stared entranced. \u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThey think a kid is gonna be better than the Captain- a nine-foot-tall robot pirate Nazi- at killing us?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI think I\u2019m in love.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />Back in the council room, the giant head was speaking.&lt;br />\u201cSilas will be taking over your duties, Captain, beginning with the extermination of those meddlesome kids, including the management of Ninja Pirate Inc, and following into our newest plan, the destruction of the town commons of South Hadley!\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />On the roof, Sam and Richard stifled screams of abject horror.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cThe town commons have long been a Mecca for teenagers of the surrounding area. With the restaurants, theatres, and the accursed Thirsty Mind, they have provided sanctuary and place of repose for those otherwise most susceptible to our influence. They must be destroyed. Once they are gone the teenagers of Western Massachusetts will become even more weak-willed and compliant. They will turn to the first helping hand they see. That hand will be ours. We will infect these noxious teenagers with several viruses hidden in our line of junk foods. They will transfer these diseases among themselves and eventually pass them on to their families. Just when the world is on the brink of a worldwide epidemic, a miraculous cure will be developed . . . by none other than the magnanimous Umbrella Corporation. We will become heroes to a panic-stricken world, and we will make obscene amounts of money.\u201d He paused here for emphasis. \u201cBut that is not the end of this glorious scheme. The medicine we give out will have powerful addictive properties. Mind-altering properties. People will not be able to live without our specialized drugs. The world will be under our control!\u201d&lt;br />The assembled council dissolved into a chorus of irate objection and confusion.&lt;br />\u201cThere\u2019s nothing flammable!\u201d&lt;br />\u201c---no undead!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cHot ass-kicking babes noticeably absent from---\u201d&lt;br />\u201c---total disregard for company policy---\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThis is my will!\u201d the giant head shouted. \u201cThis shall be done!\u201d&lt;br />A fearful hush fell over the room.&lt;br />\u201cYou all have your orders. Do not fail me.\u201d&lt;br />The screen turned black.&lt;br />&lt;br />On the roof the two brothers looked at each other. No words were said. They knew what they had to do. Silently they made there way back to the car and disappeared into the night.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />As the Millennium Falcon sped over the bridge toward South Hadley and temporary safety, Richard spoke urgently to Sam.&lt;br />\u201cSam, this is bad. This is very, very bad.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWhat you mean? The Captain is taking orders from a kid and their plot\u2019s more boring than usual. If anything, we\u2019re safer now than ever.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNo. Something isn\u2019t right. Their scheme isn\u2019t the usual wacky and erratic evil plan they\u2019re known for, but it\u2019s also not inherently flawed or flammable. I think it has a chance of succeeding. And Silas strikes me as decidedly dangerous.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou think he\u2019s hot.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cTrue, but dangerous as well. We need to call everyone in on this. We need some help.\u201d&lt;br />The car increased in speed toward the center of South Hadley.&lt;br />&lt;br />Back at the old factory, Silas sat in a swivel chair with his designer Italian shoes propped on a desk. In front of him was a massive Umbrella Corporation super computer which was, for the time being, inactive. He was reading a book on behavioral psychology with a contented expression on his handsome face. A guard entered through a side door and stood at attention behind him.&lt;br />\u201cReport.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSir, we spotted two trespassers on the roof earlier this evening. Do you wish us to pursue them?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNo, Sergeant. No need. You and your men take the night off. I already know about the intruders. I took the liberty of planting a tracking device on their vehicle before meeting the council.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSir?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cIt was two of the teens I\u2019m supposed to kill. Both rather solidly built. One with long black hair, the other with an Afro. The one with the afro was intriguing. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll kill him right off. I think I\u2019ll have some fun with that one first. Bring me the file on the targets.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYes sir.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cOh, and a Slice.\u201d&lt;br />Silas leaned farther back and returned to his reading.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Millennium Falcon tore into the Commons parking lot. Richard and Sam didn\u2019t even bother to park the car, but instead leaped out onto the pavement.&lt;br />\u201cAuto-park engage,\u201d Richard spoke into a microphone on his glove. The car sped up and crashed into a fence.&lt;br />\u201cRich, I think your auto park is broken.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cHow? That\u2019s the way I would have parked.\u201d&lt;br />Without another word they ran into the Thirsty Mind.&lt;br />&lt;br />Bursting through the doors, Richard shouted breathlessly, \u201cI need . . . use phone . . . call friends to fight evil megalomaniacal hottie and pirate robot . . .\u201d He stopped short of his odd plea as he took in the sight before him. Seemingly his entire class from school had gathered at the Thirsty Mind for a night of revelry.&lt;br />&lt;br />Richard spotted his one true partner in mayhem across the crowded caf\u00e9. He rushed forward, straining against the mass of student bodies that packed the room.&lt;br />Tara Maroney popped up out of nowhere in front of him, blocking his way.&lt;br />\u201cHey, Rich. You hair is big. What are you up to?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cGood to see you, Tara, no time to talk.\u201d Rich said, violently pushing her to the side, sending her toppling over several tables, coffee spraying into the air.&lt;br />Finally he reached the person he sought, the one person who would understand.&lt;br />\u201cTony . . .\u201d he could say no more at the moment, for he was too excited and out of breath.&lt;br />\u201cSweet Georgia Fuck, Ricardo, what is it?\u201d Tony asked urgently, supporting his friend and leading him to a chair.&lt;br />\u201cThe . . . Umbrella Corporation . . . something wrong . . . plans to destroy The Commons . . . must . . . stop . . . theh . . . heh . . . hem.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cOkay, buddy, I think you\u2019re really draggin\u2019 this breathless thing out here. Just tell me plain an\u2019 true.\u201d&lt;br />Richard straightened up and quickly composed himself.&lt;br />\u201cSam and I uncovered a plot by the Umbrella Corporation, now stationed at the old abandoned Lashler Paper Factory, to destroy the South Hadley Commons and eventually take over the world through a man-made virus and a series of addictive cures.\u201d&lt;br />Tony was speechless for a moment. He clutched his brow in a feverish manner.&lt;br />\u201cWhat the hell are we gonna do?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI don\u2019t know, Tones, I just don\u2019t know.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI can tell you one thing you fellas need to do.\u201d&lt;br />Tony and Richard whirled around to see a figure shrouded in aromatic smoke sitting across the caf\u00e9.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019m just gonna throw this out there, you can take it, run with it, or you can throw it right back. I think we need to strike first. We can\u2019t wait for them to hit the Commons. We gotta bring the fight to them.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cGood point, Steve.\u201d Rich said as he and Tony walked over to the smirking figure. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you were here.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThey let you smoke like that inside?\u201d Tony asked, covering his mouth with his hand and coughing slightly.&lt;br />\u201cWhat they don\u2019t know can\u2019t--- \u201d&lt;br />\u201cSteve, put that cigarette out.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSon of a bitch! Amy, as a fellow smoker, you of all people should understand.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cOh, sorry Steve. I feel for ya, man, I really do,\u201d Amy purred, gracefully reaching out and taking Steve\u2019s trademark clove cigarette from between his fingers. She took a puff of it herself before dropping it into an abandoned coffee mug. \u201cBut rules are rules.\u201d She paused to look at us. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you guys? You look like hell.\u201d&lt;br />The three boys looked at each other, then at Amy. Rich spoke first.&lt;br />\u201cAmy, the Umbrella Corporation is back with a vengeance. Sam and I spied on them tonight and uncovered a plot.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cA dastardly plot,\u201d corrected Tony.&lt;br />\u201cWe uncovered a dastardly plot to destroy the Commons of South Hadley.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell we need to stop them, then, don\u2019t we?\u201d Amy said without hesitation.&lt;br />\u201cSo far we\u2019re in agreement about that much,\u201d Rich explained impatiently, \u201cbut that leaves us with a tricky problem: How? The place is well defended and swarming with dangerous-looking guards.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSo was my school, Rich, and you and Amy still blasted though there like two gay guys on E. Which I have done and dealt, by the way.\u201d&lt;br />It seemed Andrew LeTellier had been listening in on their conversation.&lt;br />\u201cYou four are each one idiot if you think you\u2019re goin\u2019 after the \u2018Brella without me.\u201d Andrew said.&lt;br />\u201cGoddamnit, this is getting tedious. Everyone\u2019s volunteering, but not bringing anything new to the plan . . .. Or lack there of,\u201d said Rich.&lt;br />\u201cDudes, I know how that can be. The group consciousness just gets sucked down into the gaping black maw of apathetic complacency. It\u2019s like that at those killer Amherst hash parties.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cFuck.\u201d Rich muttered tersely. He frowned as a lanky figure in a wool sweater and scarf approached.&lt;br />Tony watched anxiously as Richard and the new arrival, their friend Pawel, greeted each other. Richard tensed up, but maintained the niceties.&lt;br />\u201cOkay,\u201d spoke Rich authoritatively, \u201cIf we\u2019re all going to be in on this, let\u2019s tell everybody. And furthermoreover, let\u2019s plan.\u201d&lt;br />Richard left the group and walked purposely over to the counter. With a leap he was on top of it.&lt;br />\u201cAttention customers of the Thirsty Mind caf\u00e9 and used book shoppe!\u201d He roared over the annoying Bob Seger tunes in the background. \u201cI apologize for the look of pain on my face, but I was working out last night and I pulled a groin muscle. Which is a shame, \u2018cause I\u2019ve been trying to give that up.\u201d He waited for the laughs to subside. \u201cIn all seriousness, folks, the look of pain on my face is genuine. I look this way because I am privy to some terrible news\u201d At this point a man in the audience stood up, shouted, \u201cOasis broke up?\u201d and ran out the door screaming.&lt;br />Richard paused, watching the crazed fan in stunned silence, then snapped out his reverie and returned to the subject at hand. \u201cThese very Commons are threatened by a terrible, evil force. I need you all to join me and fight against that force, for the good of South Hadley, the United States, and even the world. Who among you will fight alongside me?\u201d&lt;br />Half of the audience stood up and crowded together by a table in the corner, the other half remained absorbed in their cell phones, laptops, and pseudo-intellectual banter.&lt;br />\u201cWell, that\u2019s not too bad. We\u2019ll run with it.\u201d Richard said to himself with a smile, and walked over to the group.&lt;br />\u201cLadies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve got a big fight ahead of us. Our odds aren\u2019t anything to cheer about, but they\u2019re even worse if we don\u2019t have a plan. So let\u2019s look at what we\u2019ve got.\u201d&lt;br />He swiped his arm across the top of the table they had gathered around, spilling mugs, plates, and papers to the floor. He then began grabbing objects around him to make a rough map of the area they intended to attack.&lt;br />\u201cOkay! Our destination is the Lashler Paper Mill in the old factory district of Holyoke. The factory and outlying buildings are here, as represented by the plate and cups. The canal,\u201d he said, pouring a stream of coffee along the table, \u201cruns along here. This is the road,\u201d he indicated a strip of newspaper, \u201cand these are the train tracks,\u201d he pointed to a series of forks. \u201cThey run behind the factory, and into it.\u201d&lt;br />He paused to let them take it all in.&lt;br />\u201cThere is a bridge crossing the canal, but it will be heavily guarded.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWho here knows how to plan battle tactics?\u201d asked Brendan Smith.&lt;br />No one answered.&lt;br />Rich spoke up. \u201cI know someone who does.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />Dan McLaughlin rolled groggily over in bed, reached past the sleeping female form on his right and grabbed his cell phone off of an end table.&lt;br />\u201cMcLaughlin,\u201d he muttered into the receiver.&lt;br />\u201cDan, this is Rich. Sorry to wake you but we need your help.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cRich, is there no way this can wait? I plan on being busy tomorrow morning. I need my rest,\u201d Dan said, looking at the other female form sleeping to his left. This one, like the one on his right, was capable of making it into the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue, but, like the one on Dan\u2019s right, spent her time studying to get her doctorate at an Ivy League school.&lt;br />\u201cThe Umbrella Corporation is back and they plan to destroy the Commons and kill us all. We need you to plan an attack for us.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThe Umbrella Corporation? What do I care? I have no beef with them, it\u2019s not my fight.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWhat about the Commons?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSo a bunch of hippies are out of a coffee shop and the town loses a restaurant here and a theatre there. So what?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cGoddamnit, Dan, stop being so difficult! I know a man of honor such as yourself can\u2019t leave innocent people to a horrible death. I know that in your heart you want to help.\u201d&lt;br />Dan looked longingly left and right at the shapely exposed shoulders and shimmering hair, then sighed.&lt;br />\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be there in ten.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThanks Dan.\u201d\u201dDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d said Dan bitterly. He got up, put on some clothes, and reached for a jacket. The door to his room opened and a third swimsuit model grad student walked in clad only in lacy panties and carrying a can of Rediwhip and a feather duster.&lt;br />\u201cDan, baby, are you leaving?\u201d she asked dejectedly.&lt;br />\u201c\u2019Fraid so, gorgeous,\u201d said Dan as he walked past her on his way to the door. He stopped to kiss her lightly on the cheek. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure you, Kim, and Melissa will keep each other busy while I\u2019m gone.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cBaby, where are you going?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWhere am I going? I\u2019m going to save the world!\u201d And with that he ran out of the room.&lt;br />&lt;br />The assembled soldiers all glanced up from their assorted mutterings as Dan entered the Thirsty Mind. Richard stepped forward and clasped his friend\u2019s hand heartily.&lt;br />\u201cDan, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. We\u2019re lost without you.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell, let\u2019s get right down to it, shall we? Care to tell me the specifics of the case?\u201d&lt;br />Richard led him to the map he had made on the conference table. He pointed out the various structures surrounding the Umbrella Corporation\u2019s base, and explained the circumstances to Dan.&lt;br />\u201cThis is the canal,\u201d Richard pointed to the coffee spill.&lt;br />\u201cAre there tunnels beneath it?\u201d Dan asked immediately.&lt;br />\u201cI believe so. There are passages which lead into the basement levels of the main buildings.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cAnd these forks here,\u201d Dan went on, \u201crailroad tracks?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYes.\u201d&lt;br />Dan was silent for a time, he merely stared at the three dimensional representation of the place he and his friends were going to attack.&lt;br />Richard watched him keenly.&lt;br />\u201cYou\u2019ve got a plan, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.&lt;br />Dan looked up, smiling. \u201cI might.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />Five minutes later Dan had outlined a daring plan which, though requiring great skill and courage, seemed to the collected heroes to be well within the range of plausibility. There was one last matter to discuss: the time.&lt;br />\u201cDan,\u201d Richard asked, \u201cwhen do you think we should initiate your master strategy?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell, it\u2019s too late tonight. We should get some rest, and regroup here tomorrow in the afternoon. Let\u2019s say 4.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cIs that alright with anyone?\u201d Tony asked the assembled.&lt;br />The answer was a unanimous affirmative. And so, the heroes departed one by one into the night.&lt;br />&lt;br />Silas Blake extinguished his tenth cigarette in a crystal ashtray and peered at the documents before him. For the past hour and a half he had pored over the files of the teenagers he had been ordered to eliminate, and the fatigue of his night\u2019s work showed. He was wearing a loose-fitting Oxford silk shirt which he had unbuttoned nearly all the way, exposing his narrow, smooth chest. His brown hair was tussled and circles were forming under his eyes, giving him a haunted, James Dean-like appearance. He had been fascinated by the subjects of the documents, specifically the one whom he had seen eavesdropping. According to the file, the target\u2019s name was Lt. Ricardo Sanchez Sugrue III, Esq. Silas blinked curiously at the file photo: the subject flexing his biceps, clad in only Speedo that left little up to the imagination. He glanced over Richard\u2019s bio page.&lt;br />\u201cA bisexual multi-fetishist,\u201d Blake read. \u201cHighly advanced intellect in literature, history, and theology. Interests: writing, film, and . . . weight-lifting.\u201d Blake paused to glance at the bulging muscles in the photo. He sighed. \u201cTell me you\u2019re single.\u201d Turning the page, he grinned. \u201cStatus: single.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cJeezum Crowe, that\u2019s fantastic. I need to do something special for this one,\u201d Silas mused.&lt;br />Silas was creative and clever; it didn\u2019t take long for inspiration to strike. He flipped through the file until he hit upon Richard\u2019s home and e-mail address. He quickly typed the information into the super computer in front of him. Next, he produced adhesive electrode patches from a drawer and put one onto each temple. He took the wires trailing from them and plugged them into the computer.&lt;br />\u201cOh, Ricardo, wait till you get a load of this . . .\u201d Blake happily went about his work.&lt;br />&lt;br />The sun peered indifferently down at the frozen earth through a thick, grey layer of clouds, sodden, dirty cotton balls blocking the heavens from horizon to horizon. In the parking lot behind the Commons the heroes gradually began to assemble. Showing a startling break from tradition, Richard was first on the scene, with Sam, dressed smartly in combat fatigues and an army helmet inexplicably bedecked in fake branches and camouflage netting, and Caitlin, who was wearing University of Michigan football uniform and padding, along with her pearly white pooka shell necklace. They were soon joined by Tony, in his rough and tumble red Jeep, with Jake Motroni, and Steve, in the Konefal family van. The six friends stood outside their vehicles, waiting, with grim looks on their faces, for the rest of the troops. Tony was wearing his reliable Mandalorian battle armor. Dented and scratched from years of combat and adventure, it still looked formidable enough to deflect laser blasts. For the moment, Tony had his helmet off, and his long, black hair was fluttering in the wind. Steve had opted to wear a simple white T-shirt, jeans, and his old black leather jacket. Richard wore golden battle armor to match his eyes and flowing curls. They made an odd and impressive sight standing in a line in the middle of the parking lot. Next to arrive were Andrew and Justin, in the Letelliers\u2019 golden Saturn coup, with Dan McLaughlin, who was wearing his Air Force BTU\u2019s. Then there was Brendan Smith with Meg Lynch in tow in Brendan\u2019s red station wagon. Arriving sixth and seventh were Evelyn Powell and the Lapointes, and then Mike Pytka and Jason Frank, in Jason\u2019s car. Sarah Sawka was with them. Pat Dandrea, Sarah Cantler, Steph Lepine, and Adam Goddu showed up in Pat\u2019s golden van. Will Murray tore into the parking lot in his purple bomber, with Pawel, Jenn Murray, and Tara Maroney also in the car. Then came EJ, in his Saturn speedster, with Dave as trusty co-pilot, and Becky, grim and determined in the back. Finally, last to arrive was a weary-looking Amy McMenamin. Clad in her shape-fitting purple combat suit, she trudged slowly toward the group from the road.&lt;br />Richard and Steve ran forward, immediately concerned.&lt;br />\u201cAmy, what happened?\u201d asked Rich.&lt;br />\u201cNothing happened. I walked here from home.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou know, you could have called me for a ride?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cOr, better yet,\u201d said Steve, \u201ccalled me for a ride.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cAh, thanks guys. But I\u2019m fine. Is everything ready for departure?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell, as soon as Tony completes role-call and we decide how the carpool situation will work.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThis sounds more like a 4th grade field trip than an invasion,\u201d Steve commented.&lt;br />Richard turned to him angrily, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be negative maybe you\u2019d like to try organizing a movement of this magnitude.\u201d&lt;br />But Steve had already wandered off, in flirtatious conversation with Amy.&lt;br />Richard shrugged and signaled Tony.&lt;br />\u201cAll ready, chief?\u201d he asked of the Italian ninja in the Boba Fett armor.&lt;br />\u201cNow that Amy\u2019s here, yes. Although, there is one last item on the pre-invasion check list.\u201d&lt;br />Richard knew what he was getting at.&lt;br />\u201cEveryone gather \u2018round.\u201d Richard called to the 26 heroes brave enough to join him this day. \u201cIt\u2019s time for prayer.\u201d&lt;br />The friends gathered in a tight circle. Richard began.&lt;br />\u201cIn the name of the Father, of the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Lord Almighty in Heaven, be with us this day. We gather here now in friendship and with courage about to fight for a just cause. Guard us, and help us, o Lord, to achieve our noble goal. Also,\u201d here he winked at Tony, \u201cplease forgive us for any grievous violence, theft, property destruction, and adultery we commit today.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cAdultery?\u201d asked Dan.&lt;br />\u201cJust covering all our bases. And, Dear God, give us the strength and the wisdom to follow your will. Bless us all. Amen.\u201d&lt;br />On cue, 23 of the assemble threw their fists into the air and shouted, \u201cYay God!\u201d&lt;br />On the outskirts of the circle, Amy, Dave, and Jake looked at each other quizzically.&lt;br />\u201cMust be a Holyoke Catholic thing,\u201d ventured Amy.&lt;br />Richard took a deep breath of the cold, moist, late-autumn air. \u201cNow let\u2019s head out!\u201d&lt;br />And the noble convoy began to form.&lt;br />In the lead was Richard, the only driver who knew the way. In his car were Sam, the diligent co-pilot, riding shotgun, and Caitlin, pretty and somber, in the back seat. Next in the convoy was Steve\u2019s van, carrying Steve and Amy, and, much to Steve\u2019s chagrin, Evelyn Powell and the Lapointes, both Marissa and Ashley. Third came Pat Dandrea, with the assorted underclassmen, Adam, Steph, and Sarah, as well as Jason Frank, Sarah Sawka, and Mike Pytka. Will\u2019s admirable old cruiser took fourth place, and contained Pawel, Tara, Brendan, and Meg, and, piloting the solid vessel with a keen eye and a smile, Will Murray himself. Fifth was Andrew\u2019s Saturn, veteran of the Maine expedition, with Andrew, Justin, EJ, Dave and Dan inside. Bringing up the rear was Tony\u2019s rumbling Jeep. Its only passengers were the crazy ninja himself, who was adeptly steering, shifting, and eating a bowel of alfredo all at once, and Jake, the only person crazy enough to ride with Tony.&lt;br />So the heroes ventured out on that fateful day, a stream of assorted cars, heading south on route 116, toward Holyoke and destiny.&lt;br />&lt;br />Meanwhile, back at the Umbrella Corporation\u2019s local headquarters, Silas keenly watched a computer screen showing the convoy\u2019s progress.&lt;br />\u201cJust as expected. The fools are coming right to me.\u201d&lt;br />A guard marched smartly into the room and saluted. Blake paid no attention as he continued to watch the screen while dressing in his customized battle armor.&lt;br />\u201cSir. The enemy are on their way. Do you wish us to prepare the complex for battle?\u201d&lt;br />Silas looked up, snapping a barbed titanium gauntlet onto his wrist.&lt;br />\u201cNo, sergeant. There is too much fragile equipment here. I don\u2019t want those ruffians upsetting any of our special projects. Instead, get three units together and meet me outside. Bring a few deathbots and rouse that mechanical oaf Cap\u2019n Adolph Lenin Huzuki-bot 3500. I want him to be there for the enemy\u2019s inevitable defeat. I want him to see what he\u2019d been doing wrong all those times. Make sure your men are ready and well armed. Let\u2019s kick this pig.\u201d He finished, cocking a shotgun.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Millennium Falcon, in all its shining maroon glory, sped along the same canal road it had the night before. Richard stayed sharp at the wheel as always, perhaps even especially sharp today, only hitting four pedestrians. He spoke into a CB radio on the dashboard.&lt;br />\u201cBreaker, breaker. This is Han Frolo. We are approaching destination point. Over.\u201d&lt;br />Bringing up the rear in his crimson Jeep, Tony responded.&lt;br />\u201cRoger, Han Frolo. This is Red Rambler. You lead the way; I\u2019ll follow in zombie ass-kicking pursuit. Over.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWoo wee, you sunbitchpileamonkeyspunk. That is good to hear!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI reckon it should be ya ol\u2019 goatfuckinloadaturtleshit!\u201d&lt;br />The witty banter might have continued had Steve not come on the line.&lt;br />\u201cHey, uh, guys, would you mind not doing that anymore? It\u2019s scarin\u2019 the laydays. \u2018Kay? However, if you wanted to join me in a chorus of Afternoon Delight, that\u2019s another matter.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou serious?\u201d Richard asked.&lt;br />\u201cThat\u2019s a 10-4 good buddy,\u201d Steve responded.&lt;br />And in unison Tony, Richard, and Steve began to sing.&lt;br />\u201cGonna grab my baby, gonna hold her tight, gonna grab some afternoon delight. My motto\u2019s always been when it\u2019s right it\u2019s right, so why wait until the middle of a cold dark night?\u201d&lt;br />The convoy surged along relentlessly, led by the song of determination and fury.&lt;br />\u201cWheeeeeeehhhhnn the lovin\u2019s always sweeter than the light of day. Aaaaannnd the night is gonna be there anyway!\u201d&lt;br />Tony and Steve began to harmonize.&lt;br />\u201cRubbin\u2019 sticks an\u2019 stones together watchin\u2019 sparks ignite----\u201d&lt;br />They would have gone on in such a manner had Rich not interrupted.&lt;br />\u201cBelay the shanty, lads. There be trouble off the port and starboard bows!\u201d&lt;br />Tony and Steve glanced urgently left and right. Speeding toward the convoy were a dozen Umbrella Corporation black SUV\u2019s, six on each side. They had sneaked up unnoticed and were now heading with terrible intent, straight at the line of cars.&lt;br />Richard was quick to take action, activating shields and ion canons. He fired at the first SUV, sending it spinning away, powerless. The second vehicle fired its own cannons, taking out all of Richard\u2019s offense weaponry. It then fired an energy grappling hook, and reeled the Falcon slowly in. Another SUV tried to tackle Tony\u2019s Jeep, but the feisty Italian swerved into it, slicing the vehicle open with his plow blade and the SUV wheeled away. Steve rammed another, pushing it off a conveniently placed, ramp-like pile of roadwork supplies, and into the canal. Richard tried to drive to combat another oncoming SUV, but he was too late. The sleek black vehicles tore into the line of cars, scattering them to all directions. When all seemed lost to chaos, the Umbrella trucks began to push the separated cars to some preordained destination. They fired more electrical conduit bonds at the vehicles, trapping them, making them easy to control. The SUV\u2019s were in amongst the heroes\u2019 rides like wolves in a herd of sheep. They meticulously drove them away from the UC headquarters and back into the redbrick blocks of factories and warehouses that populated this district.&lt;br />Richard tried desperately to swerve away, to speed ahead, to escape, but the enemy vehicles were too fast. They pushed and smashed relentlessly, forcing the Falcon and all the other cars down side streets and around corners with ruthless efficiency.&lt;br />Richard caught sight of an alleyway to his right and decided to take a chance.&lt;br />\u201cEveryone, alley on the right, follow me!\u201d&lt;br />One by one the cars broke the Umbrella Corporation\u2019s electrical restraints and swerved down the alley after Richard and the Falcon.&lt;br />In the lead UC SUV, Silas smiled.&lt;br />\u201cJust as I thought, they\u2019ve fallen right into our trap.&lt;br />As the Falcon tore down the alleyway, Richard allowed himself a smile as well. The convoy was free; they had made their escape. Just a few minutes to regroup and they\u2019d be on their way back to the UC headquarters.&lt;br />The smile faded from his face, to be replaced by a look of despair and frustration as he saw what lay in wait for them outside the alley.&lt;br />Twelve more SUV\u2019s spanned the road, six on a side, creating an unbreakable gauntlet the heroes had to drive through. Canons on the SUV\u2019s were at full power and aimed right at them.&lt;br />\u201cOh fuck!\u201d Richard yelled as his car sped out of the alley and between the rows of enemy canons.&lt;br />The guns fired mercilessly upon the convoy, sending the heroes\u2019 rides rocking back and forth erratically and badly jarring the passengers within. Just as the Falcon\u2019s shields were beginning to weaken, Richard blasted the car past the end of the gauntlet and into the alleyway on the other side of the road.&lt;br />He sighed and looked at Sam, sitting in the seat next to him.&lt;br />\u201cWell we\u2019re outta that frying pan----\u201d Richard stopped when he turned his attention back to the scene in front of him and saw where they had ended up.&lt;br />The convoy had been driven into a vast courtyard, surrounded on all sides by the brick walls of the adjacent warehouses and factories. The courtyard itself, probably twenty acres, was crammed with towering heaps of scrap metal, rusted and bent, twisted and shredded. Amongst the piles were mammoth pieces of heavy machinery; giant mechanical dinosaurs, their chipped and rusted yellow hides standing stark against the leaden sky. There were excavators, magnets, and cranes, bulldozers and backhoes. To Richard\u2019s left were massive abandoned concrete blocks, arranged in a mad pattern like a post-modern Stonehenge. Elsewhere, between the mountains of scrap metal, heavy machinery, and concrete blocks were rusting oil drums, discarded tools, and automotive parts. To Richard\u2019s right was a huge conveyor belt on which cubes of compacted metal were sent into a factory behind them to be processed.&lt;br />In the center of the yard was the most imposing structure of all. A terrifying industrial monster framed against the heaps of scrap metal. The compactor. Its infinitely powerful jaws were still for the moment, open and held toward the sky as if awaiting rain to quench its thirst. Around the perimeter of the metal compactor was a steel platform, with a railing of pipe. The compactor was surrounded by a small herd of forklifts.&lt;br />Richard got out of the Falcon and looked around. The place seemed deserted. The eerie stillness of the hulking metallic beasts around him sent a shiver down his spine.&lt;br />Behind him Tony was stepping out of his scratched and dented Jeep. He stared in silent anger at the damage that had been dealt to his beloved ride before turning to Rich.&lt;br />\u201cWhere the hell are we?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI know,\u201d Richard said absently, looking around. \u201cFor some reason the Umbrella Corporation has herded us into the Sullivan Steel scrap yard.\u201d&lt;br />Brendan spoke up, gingerly touching a cut on his forehead. \u201cSo you expect me to believe that this corporation closed off a whole street with mysterious black SUV\u2019s and pushed ten cars into a steel mill- that they had arranged to be abandoned- without anybody noticing?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cUmbrella has closed off whole cities with walls 50 feet tall. This is a walk in the park for them.\u201d Tony explained.&lt;br />\u201cWell,\u201d said Caitlin, voicing the concern they had all felt, \u201cnow that they have us here, what do they intend to do?\u201d&lt;br />As soon as she had said this, heavy steel gates closed behind the heroes, trapping them in the industrial wasteland. Then, before anyone could react, two doors opened, one on either side of the compound. A battalion of Umbrella guards filed out of each doorway. They were all dressed in black, concussion-resistant armor and carrying laser rifles. Gleaming, red-eyed battle masks hid their faces. Each battalion was followed by two hulking deathbots, which opened and closed their pincer arms menacingly. Out of the door to Richard\u2019s right tramped Captain Adolph Lenin Huzuki-bot 3500. Richard noticed a sadness in the Captain\u2019s human eye, and his bulky shoulders were slumped.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t looking good,\u201d remarked Andrew, gazing around in fear. \u201cAnyone got any ideas?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cHow\u2019s this for an idea: You all die!\u201d Silas Blake shouted, flying out of the door to Richard\u2019s left, a jet pack on his back. He fired a blast from his laser rifle. It struck Steph Lepine in the shoulder, sending her to the ground with a cry of anguish. Adam Goddu whipped out twin .45 caliber pistols and fired at Silas. Many of his shots would have done damage, but the maniac had surrounded himself with a force field generated from a red glowing belt buckle. Steve meanwhile had stepped over to Steph\u2019s side and was gently administering to her injuries.&lt;br />\u201cGet away from her!\u201d Adam cried, tearing his attention away from Silas, who had contented himself with floating in the air and watching the drama unfold below, a smug smile on his beautiful face.&lt;br />\u201cWhoa, amigo,\u201d Steve said, trying to mollify the enraged Goddu. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help. Nurse in training, you know.\u201d&lt;br />Tony stepped forward. He put a hand on Adam\u2019s solid shoulder.&lt;br />\u201cShe\u2019ll be alright with Steve. We can\u2019t afford to fight amongst ourselves. We\u2019ve got a battle to win! Help Richard unload the guns from the Falcon, I\u2019ll handle Silas! Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll pay for hurting Steph.\u201d&lt;br />Tony tightened his grip on Adam\u2019s shoulder for emphasis before buckling on his own jet pack, unsheathing his katana, and taking to the sky after Blake.&lt;br />Silas drew his own blade, a beautifully replicated 10th Century Saxon broad sword. He took a fighting stance in the air, awaiting Tony. The Italian ninja caught Blake off guard, though, so fast was his attack, and sent the villain reeling with a flying shoulder butt. Silas crashed into the arm of a crane, shattering his force field belt. He shook his head to clear his senses, and flew back to meet Tony. Richard, watching form below, had never seen his friend battle so ferociously. Enraged at the cowardly the attack on one he cared so much for, Tony fought with a boundless fury that could not be stopped. Still, Blake managed to counter every one of Tony\u2019s attacks. It seemed to Rich as though Silas knew the attack before it came. Richard tore his attention from the battle above and focused on the crisis at hand. The enemy soldiers had not yet begun to fire. Indeed, they seemed to waiting for a signal. Silas had his hands full fighting Tony, and the Captain made no attempt to step in as leader. Nonetheless, Richard had to see that his friends were properly armed and ready. He darted forward and opened the rear cargo hold of the Falcon. Clearing aside and old tire and some cans and bottles, he reached the cache laser rifles that came standard with the Oldsmobile Regency 98.&lt;br />\u201cAttention! There\u2019re these,\u201d Richard said, indicating the rifles in the trunk, \u201cand a plethora of other weapons hidden inside the Falcon. Take your pick, but make it snappy. There\u2019s no telling when those Umbrella goons\u2019ll start their attack. Oh, and make sure it\u2019s one weapon per person, we\u2019ve got quite a crowd today.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />Tony and Silas were fighting an amazing battle in the air above. The clang of steel upon steel echoed around the vast courtyard. Tony was an expert swordsman, but Silas matched him parry for parry, thrust for thrust. Silas blocked one of Tony\u2019s attacks, knocked his sword aside, and punched him in the mouth. Tony tasted blood. He swung high and Silas positioned his blade to deflect his enemy\u2019s. Tony took advantage of the opening and delivered a solid kick to Blake\u2019s exposed stomach, sending the villain flying backward.&lt;br />Silas triggered his thrusters and blasted forward, blade held steadily in front of him. Tony obliged him and charged forward as well. They swung mightily, the clash sending angry hornets buzzing down the lengths of their swords to their gloved hands. They tore past each other, spun \u2018round, and charged again in a futuristic interpretation of medieval jousting. They continued for many passes, but Silas eventually gained the upper hand. He flew forward for another clash, but dodged downward at the last minute, leaving Tony to strike out at vacant air. Below his enemy, Silas swung swiftly with his sword. The blade, sharpened by lasers to the millionth of an inch, sliced though Tony\u2019s Mandalorian battle armor like a razor blade through paper. A deep gash opened on the ninja\u2019s leg and began to bleed profusely.&lt;br />Tony clenched his teeth against the pain and turned to face Blake.&lt;br />\u201cThat one looked like it hurt, Tony,\u201d Blake jeered. \u201cHad about enough.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI live for this,\u201d Tony said, reaching down and exploring the laceration with his fingers. He brought his bloodstained hand up and licked his fingertips.&lt;br />\u201cMmmm . . . mother\u2019s milk.\u201d&lt;br />He charged.&lt;br />Silas, taken aback at this deranged display of savagery, was once again caught off guard. Tony brought his katana whistling downward in a broad chop and left a deep scratch in Silas\u2019 breastplate. Silas staggered backward through the air, barely blocking Tony\u2019s renewed attacks. He finally ran out of room to back-peddle in, bumping against the arm of another crane. He deflected one, two, three of Tony\u2019s swipes and thrust his sword at Tony\u2019s abdomen. The Italian dodged to the left, but too slowly. The villain\u2019s blade grazed his side. Seemingly defeated, Tony took one last awkward swing. Silas easily dodged it and was about to laugh at the pathetic attempt when he realized Tony hadn\u2019t been aiming for him. The arm of the crane behind him slowly slid in half; Tony\u2019s slice had cut it clearly and silently. Just before the weight of the girders and cables crushed him, Silas took a desperate swing. His sword didn\u2019t quite hit Tony- it was off by millimeters- but it did succeed in severing the strap which was holding Tony\u2019s jet pack on. Silas was pushed to the earth and, with a cry of dismay, Tony followed him, leaving his jet pack floating in the air.&lt;br />Tony hit the earth with a squelch; recent rain had made the ground soft. He was hurt, but it could have been worse. He limped over to a cluster of oil drums and slid to a sitting position with his back to one, favoring his left leg.&lt;br />Silas managed to slow his descent using his thrusters. Just before impact he slid from under the oppressive weight of the rusted steel and landed a few feet away. The arm of the crane crashed heavily into the muddy ground, screeching and clanging in agony. Silas got up. He tenderly rubbed an aching shoulder. A few scrapes and bruises, he thought, but otherwise none the worse for wear. His jet pack was another story. It had sustained grievous damage in the fall and was far from being in working order. He unstrapped it and let it fall to the ground. Once he had gotten his bearings straight he realized what was out of place with the scene: There was no battle. The UC troops had yet to attack.&lt;br />He sprinted over to the formation and berated them.&lt;br />\u201cIdiots! Why have you not begun the slaughter? What were you waiting for, invitations on flowered stationary?\u201d&lt;br />A lieutenant stepped forward and saluted.&lt;br />\u201cSir. We were awaiting orders, sir.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cHuzuki-twit didn\u2019t give you any?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNo, sir.\u201d&lt;br />Silas picked up a pipe and walked over to the Captain, who was standing very still, a sad, far-off look in his eyes. Wordlessly, Silas swung the pipe upward, striking the Captain on his heavy, bearded jaw. The robo-pirate-ninja stumbled backward and glared at Silas. He advanced upon the fiend, a menacing gleam in his red, robotic eye.&lt;br />Silas stood his ground.&lt;br />\u201cWhat are you going to do? Hit me?\u201d he taunted. \u201cI\u2019m your new boss, remember? Touch me and I liquidate NP Inc and have you sent here for scrap metal, you oaf! Never sit idly by in a battle situation again!\u201d&lt;br />Silas turned to the assembled troops.&lt;br />\u201cYou want orders? Here they are: Attack! Destroy! Leave no one alive!\u201d&lt;br />The soldiers opened fire on the car blockade and began to advance.&lt;br />&lt;br />While the small army were selecting their choice tools from Richard\u2019s arsenal, Richard himself ducked into the Falcon and activated her shields. He manipulated the switches and knobs until he had spread the energy barrier over every car in the formation, and turned it up to its full power.&lt;br />He emerged from the vehicle and drew a pistol from a belt holster.&lt;br />\u201cAll right everyone, we need to split up.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cZoinks!\u201d Andrew gulped. \u201cLike, I hate it when he says that.\u201d&lt;br />Richard went on. \u201cDan, care to handle the particulars?\u201d&lt;br />The Cadet was in his element, and directed the troops with vigor.&lt;br />\u201cAll underclassmen! You\u2019re too young for battle. Stay here and guard Steph and the vehicles.\u201d He ignored the groans of protest.&lt;br />\u201cNext, current high school seniors. Pat, Jason, Mike, Sarah, Dave.&lt;br />You are to sneak around the mountains of scrap metal- only after the enemy is distracted- and make your way to the rear of the army, attacking them from behind.\u201d&lt;br />The seniors nodded dutifully and readied their weapons.&lt;br />\u201cLastly, this year\u2019s college freshmen.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cAnd sophomores.\u201d Added Amy.&lt;br />\u201cAnd sophomores,\u201d said Dan.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019m always left out,\u201d Justin LeTellier lamented.&lt;br />\u201cAnd juniors,\u201d Dan added thoughtfully.&lt;br />\u201cAll right!\u201d yelled Justin grinning.&lt;br />\u201cCollege freshmen, sophomores, and juniors. We will attack the enemy head-on. This may seem fool-hearty, but we have some decided advantages. First, in front of the Umbrella brigades is a good deal of open ground. They must cross this and they have no cover. We, on the other hand, have a good deal of cover. Second, we have reinforcements here and coming around the back. Third, we\u2019ve got heart, damnit! Now let\u2019s get out there and fight.\u201d&lt;br />A raucous cheer went up from the heroes behind the wall of cars.&lt;br />\u201cAnd remember,\u201d Richard said as he moved toward he fray with the other college-age students, \u201cdo not kill anyone. These are human beings we\u2019re fighting, so set your laser rifles to stun. Now, be careful out there. Those villains are playing for keeps.\u201d&lt;br />As if on cue, a barrage of laser bolts collided into the shield wall, and several of the assembled adventurers jumped.&lt;br />Dan leapt forward, brandishing his rifle.&lt;br />\u201cMy group, follow me! When we\u2019re gone, seniors head to the right and wrap around, attack from behind. Underclassmen, stay here and cover us. Guard Steph. Guard the cars. If anything goes wrong, get the hell out of here. Now, my group, chaaaarge!\u201d&lt;br />Dan scrambled over the hood of the Falcon and dove, under heavy laser fire, behind a large concrete block. His troops followed him, doing the same. The heroic college brigade were all positioned behind the massive cement pillars. Chips of stone flew off from the adventurers\u2019 cover as the Umbrella troops increased their fire. The sharp bits of concrete caused minor damage as the grazed past the huddled students. One such shard sliced across Dan\u2019s cheek. His hand went immediately up to the new wound and came back bloody. This served only to rile the young cadet, and, with a bellow of rage, he burst out from his secure spot and opened fire on the closely clustered Umbrella Corporation soldiers. Two well-aimed laser blasts knocked a goon unconscious. Another numbed the arm of the soldier close to him. Dan made it to another concrete shield and rested. Inspired by his courage, Dan\u2019s troops poured out in a wave, firing devastatingly into the lines of soldiers. Seven more went down. However, so numerous were the UC troops that hardly had those seven soldiers hit the ground than another seven stepped in to formation in their place. Still, the villains\u2019 progress was halted and the heroes had made it to the next line of concrete blocks.&lt;br />Dan knew that only superior tactics would see his friends through. He called back to the clustered heroes over the roar of battle.&lt;br />\u201cOn my signal, move to the third line of cover and form three rows. Right now, find one soldier and aim for him as you move out.\u201d He paused, selected his target, and then said, \u201cNow!\u201d&lt;br />The heroes once again leapt from their cover, firing into the enemy ranks. This time, however, their attack was more focused, and a score of Umbrella soldiers were taken out. Quickly and efficiently, they formed three rows.&lt;br />Before the enemy had a chance to recover, Dan was already commanding his unit.&lt;br />\u201cFirst row, up and fire.\u201d&lt;br />The first line of students rose and let loose a volley at the UC army.&lt;br />\u201cFirst row down. Second row, up and fire!\u201d&lt;br />Another powerful blast hit the enemy.&lt;br />\u201cSecond row down. Third row, up and fire!\u201d&lt;br />Dan continued like this, thinning the enemy ranks considerably. He knew it wasn\u2019t a permanent solution; there were none in battle. He just hoped Silas didn\u2019t think of anything before he did.&lt;br />&lt;br />Andrew, feeling cramped behind the concrete blocks, took off to the side and, dodging behind scrap metal and automotive parts, opened fire sporadically into the enemy.&lt;br />&lt;br />Silas saw that his army was in disarray and acted quickly. He ordered his troops to cluster behind the imposing deathbots. The powerful robotic menaces generated their own force field, which would protect the huddled soldiers. Moreover, the deathbots were difficult, near impossible, to halt. They acted as cover and moved forward relentlessly, their heavy, spiked treads crushing the scrap metal beneath. Dan was lost for a way out as the deathbots slowly rolled closer. His troops were pinned down and had little hope for reprieve from the canons of the approaching tank-like robots.&lt;br />Suddenly, the high school seniors of delta squadron came rushing from behind the Umbrella army and opened fire on the soldiers who, though protected in the front, were dangerously exposed in the rear.&lt;br />Dave, who had opted to find his own weapon in the mess of the Falcon\u2019s interior, had created some volatile Molotov cocktails from empty beer bottles, rags, and flammable roofing chemicals he found in Rich\u2019s ride. These he threw to devastating effect. Though they were in flame-retardant suits, the flashes of light from the bursts of flame blinded the UC troops. And, where the flame was the most consuming, the oxygen was drained from the air around them, which resulted in several of the soldiers passing out.&lt;br />&lt;br />Silas saw that once again, Dan had bested him. He knew that his advantage of numbers would soon be eliminated if his troops were forced to fight at such long range. He sent orders through the headsets of the soldiers.&lt;br />\u201cAttention!\u201d he yelled. \u201cBreak off from long distance shoot outs. Make this a close range fight. Hand to hand, if it comes to it. Use the weight of your numbers to break them. Attack!\u201d&lt;br />So, with the deathbots remaining in position, the UC soldiers gripped their rifles like clubs and charged at concrete pylons behind which the heroes lay. Some of the army did an about face and engaged delta squadron in close quarters combat.&lt;br />The deathbots, unwilling for the moment to fire upon their own soldiers, took any shots they could, but those were usually limited and ineffective. However, every so often a deathbot would surge forward and attack one of the heroes with its heavy pincer arms.&lt;br />And so, the battle dissolved into primitive chaos, with both sides attacking furiously.&lt;br />&lt;br />Meanwhile, Andrew LeTellier was racing around the outskirts of the battle, firing into the fray whenever he saw a decent shot. His natural clumsiness had seemingly vanished, and he had not slipped up yet. (Save for the one time he hit his own team member with a misjudged blast of his laser rifle.)&lt;br />Mike Pytka had been gallantly fencing with a laser rapier, leaping from concrete block to oil drum and deflecting attacks left and right in the swashbuckling tradition of Errol Flynn when suddenly a blast from a laser rifle struck him in the back of the head. With a faint cry, the blonde hero crumpled to the ground in a heap.&lt;br />Back on the fringes of the battle, Andrew pulled nervously at his collar upon seeing what he had done. However, nothing could keep the lanky crusader down for long, and he continued his laser-blasting laps around the perimeter of the massed armies. Andrew gracefully leapt over obstructions, dodged under vehicles, rolled across the ground, both marksman and acrobat. He caught sight of Evelyn Powell across the fray. She was struggling to fend off two Umbrella soldiers, swinging her laser rifle bravely, but slowly being overpowered. Andrew put on an extra burst of speed to reach her in time, but suddenly, his foot caught on something and he went tumbling to the ground in a heap of gangly limbs. Andrew shook the stars from his vision and looked up. Silas Blake was standing above him, foot still extended after having tripped the hero. Silas glanced from Andrew to Evelyn.&lt;br />\u201cSorry. Did I trip you on your way to save your pretty friend?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou heartless jerk, she\u2019s outnumbered!\u201d\u201dOh, I can see that. You\u2019d better get to her quick. You might be able to save her\u201d&lt;br />Andrew got up.&lt;br />\u201cUnless, of course, I get to her first.\u201d&lt;br />Andrew\u2019s eyes widened in shock, but then he smiled.&lt;br />\u201cAre you saying you want to race?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cExactly.\u201d&lt;br />Andrew stared down at the shorter Blake.&lt;br />\u201cWell, then I\u2019ll be happy to accept your challenge.\u201d&lt;br />Silas and Andrew locked eyes for less than a second and then both took off like lightning.&lt;br />Andrew, the lanky track star, was surprised to see Silas matching him stride for stride. The bastard\u2019s fast, Andrew thought to himself as they tore over the uneven terrain. The battle they were racing around was ranging over a massive area of land. Feet pounded doggedly into the turf as they sought to circumnavigate the sprawling fray. Hearts pounding, sweat beading on their foreheads, the two competitors raced. Both boys leapt over the scrap metal and auto parts, dodged around forklifts and concrete blocks.&lt;br />In a startling display of athleticism, Andrew ran up the side of one such concrete block, his body horizontal for several seconds, and leapt in front of Silas, forcing the villain into second place. The race continued, Andrew having gained several feet. The opponents never once let their pace lag, but instead kept it continually increasing. They ran flat out across the rugged, metal-strewn ground. Andrew was in the lead, but the race was taking its toll. His lungs began to burn; his legs ache. His combat armor was soaked with sweat. Silas was taxed to the limit as well. He had never raced anyone so fast before.&lt;br />Suddenly, Silas put on an astonishing burst of speed and blasted past Andrew. The tall hero could only watch helplessly as Silas reached Evelyn first. Without slowing down he extended his arm away from his body and ran straight at the valiant girl, who had dispatched one Umbrella Corp soldier and was focusing on the other. Evelyn turned just in time to see Silas collide into her. She was struck by the extended arm, a devastating clothesline attack, and, her legs flipping violently into the air, she crashed to the ground. Andrew, seeing this, used up his last reserve of speed and flung himself into the air, both feet first. His two-legged drop kick hit Silas in the chest with all the force of a speeding car, and the fiend was hurled backward onto the muddy ground. Andrew, unable to get his legs back underneath him, also hit the ground. He was up first, however, and quickly dashed over to Evelyn, who was still lying on her back amid the chaos of the battle. He helped her to her feet, and, supporting her gently, guided her over to a concrete block on the edge of the fray. He helped her into a sitting position, gave her a laser rifle, and left her in the relative safety of the cement pillar. He then turned his attention to Silas. Anger flickered in Andrew\u2019s eyes as he strode toward the fiend, still lying motionless on the ground. His fists clenched and unclenched. Fully intent on avenging his friend, Andrew was too absorbed in his fury to notice Silas stir. As soon as Andrew was close enough, Blake spun himself on the ground like a break-dancer, scissoring out his legs and hitting the back of Andrew\u2019s knees. Andrew collapsed to the ground beside Silas, who quickly scrambled over and began to pummel the downed hero mercilessly. Andrew\u2019s hand feverishly searched the ground for something to use as a weapon. His fingers closed upon a discarded slab of wood. Gripping it tightly, he brought the beam swinging through the air. It struck Silas in the side of the head, and the villain was once again down. Andrew wiped at a stream of blood pouring out of his aching nose and picked himself up. He staggered to Silas, bent over, grabbed the fiend by the collar, and heaved him to his feet. Furiously he slammed Silas into a forklift. He brought his face close to the villains and spoke in a dangerous whisper.&lt;br />\u201cYou\u2019ll regret hurting my friends. I\u2019ll send you to hell, you son of a bitch.\u201d&lt;br />Silas looked at him through dim, half-closed eyes and smiled. \u201cSee you there, Stretch.\u201d&lt;br />His eyes suddenly opened wide and alert as he stabbed at Andrew\u2019s vulnerable stomach with a knife he had been concealing. Andrew\u2019s face contorted in pain and a stream of red liquid dripped out from his combat armor. Silas maliciously twisted the blade, and was rewarded by a crunching tearing sound, undoubtedly Andrew\u2019s innards and ribs being ripped and broken. Andrew released his grip on the villain\u2019s collar and tumbled to the ground. Silas, leaving the knife protruding from Andrew\u2019s stomach, dashed away to cause more mayhem.&lt;br />&lt;br />The tide of battle had turned in favor of the Umbrella Corporation troops, and Dan was at a loss for what to do. His fatigues were torn and soiled. Blood dripped from countless wounds on his young frame. He wiped a heavy hand across his worried brow and gazed at the melee before him.&lt;br />Everywhere he looked, his troops were fighting admirably. Justin LeTellier had grouped together with bandmates Will Murray and Brendan Smith. The three of them were pinned behind a small pile of scrap metal by an approaching deathbot. Both of the machine\u2019s laser canons were firing relentlessly at the young friends. Justin managed a glance at their mechanic enemy. He saw how hopeless the situation was. He turned to his comrades.&lt;br />\u201cDamnit all!\u201d he shouted. \u201cOur friends are falling out there! We need to help them!\u201d&lt;br />He kicked a nearby oil drum in frustration. Instead of tipping over as he had expected it to do, the barrel remained still and his ankle was given a jolt. \u201cOww! This frickin\u2019 oil drum is still full!\u201d&lt;br />This caught Will\u2019s attention. While Brendan was busy firing he turned to Justin.&lt;br />\u201cIt\u2019s full? That gives me an idea.\u201d&lt;br />Brendan and Justin grappled and struggled to tip the drum over and roll in into position. Closing in steadily was the menacing deathbot.&lt;br />With a surge of combined power, Brendan and Justin sent the barrel rolling toward the deathbot. Still focused on exterminating the three small threats behind the rocks, the machine paid little attention to the oil drum, even as it rolled to a stop between the robot\u2019s left and right treads. Justin and Brendan then ran from the cover of the concrete block, firing erratically at the deathbot. The machine\u2019s attention was diverted, and its canons followed the two heroes as they dodged for more cover. Will, taking advantage of the distraction, stood up and aimed right for the oil barrel underneath the clanking monstrosity targeting his two friends. The laser from his weapon ignited the flammable contents in the barrel, and, in a gust of fire, the deathbot was blown to pieces. The explosion was bigger than Will had counted on, and he was thrown backward as the blast of burning air rushed from the center of the conflagration. The huge ball of flame flew into the air an intense orange, before curling downward in a choking cloud of black. Justin and Brendan made their way to their dizzy friend and helped him to stand. Will\u2019s face was coated with ash, and his hair was singed. He rubbed soot from his glasses and peered at the destruction around him.&lt;br />\u201cWow,\u201d he said.&lt;br />\u201cYeah,\u201d said Justin, \u201cyou sure played that drum well!\u201d He grinned and gave a thumbs-up to his friends. \u201cGet it, oil drum? Will plays the drums?\u201d&lt;br />Brendan pushed his friend\u2019s raised thumb back down. \u201cEasy their, killer. Just settle down and play your git fiddle.\u201d&lt;br />No sooner had he spoken than a dozen Umbrella goons charged through the smoke and rubble, laser rifles firing. The friends grew instantly serious, grabbed their weapons, and ran to meet the oncoming foe.&lt;br />Dan looked away from that small victory to see how his other friends were doing. EJ was blundering around the battle, seemingly oblivious to all around him. He was swinging a tire iron taken from the Falcon and reciting Haikus. Pawel and Marissa, fighting through the fray, wound up next to him.&lt;br />\u201cHey, EJ,\u201d Marissa called, wielding a gun which shot quick-hardening, super-strong foam, \u201cdo you wanna come and join us. Three is good number. It\u2019ll be just like our old AP study groups.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI cannot, dear friends,\u201d answered EJ, beaning a passing soldier with his tire iron, \u201cI am in search of my comrade, Lord Dominic.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou mean Dave?\u201d Pawel asked between slashes of his scimitar.&lt;br />\u201cExactly.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cCome with us, we\u2019ll help you solve that enigmatic dilemma.\u201d Pawel ventured, struggling with a particularly large enemy soldier.&lt;br />EJ cracked the soldier over the head, knocking him unconscious, and Pawel breathed freely for a moment.&lt;br />\u201cThanks, dude. Now, off to find Dave!\u201d&lt;br />And the three compatriots tore off into the center of the battle, swinging, shooting, and clubbing.&lt;br />Dan looked to his right to see Sarah Sawka and Jason Frank. They were taking turns, Jason firing shots from his laser rifle, and Sarah hurling small concussion grenades into masses of the enemy troops.&lt;br />Nearby that pair were Pat Dandrea and Caitlin, fighting back-to-back. Pat was grappling with two UC goons while Caitlin was using a blowgun to fire special darts into the fray. Each dart was a toothpick liberally soaked in a fast-acting tranquilizer.&lt;br />Richard fought his way through to Cait and Pat, and the three formed a triangle of fury, battering through the enemy ranks. Richard looked over at Caitlin.&lt;br />\u201cLookin\u2019 good, Cait. I heard you were a skilled blower.\u201d&lt;br />Pat giggled.&lt;br />Caitlin stopped firing and glared at her curly-haired comrade.&lt;br />\u201cGet lost, Rich, before I take two of these toothpicks and blind you with them.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYeah, Rich,\u201d Pat joked along, \u201cYou\u2019re cramping our style.\u201d&lt;br />Richard shrugged. \u201cI can take a hint.\u201d He strode off into the battle, firing his laser rifle with accuracy and skill.&lt;br />Caitlin looked to Pat for an answer.&lt;br />\u201cI didn\u2019t expect him to actually leave.\u201d&lt;br />Pat knocked an enemy soldier out and said, \u201cMaybe he has a very literal mind.\u201d&lt;br />Caitlin nodded, smiled, and launched another dart. It stuck an enemy solider, who slumped and collapsed to the ground. But not before firing one last shot in his delirium. The laser blast struck the soldier next to him in the arm.&lt;br />Caitlin grinned in satisfaction.&lt;br />Dan fired several shots at a passing deathbot before turning his attention to another group of his friends.&lt;br />Ashley Lapointe and Meg Lynch were firing into the enemy ranks with fierce determination.&lt;br />\u201cI kinda like the kickback from this rifle,\u201d said Ashley, a randy smile on her face. \u201cEspecially when I shoot from the hip.\u201d&lt;br />Meg downed another UC trooper and glanced at her friend with an exasperated grin.&lt;br />\u201cJust don\u2019t let your boyfriend know about your new interest.&lt;br />A soldier had sneaked up on the two girls from behind and was about to fire when Jake Motroni swooped in and laid the villain out. He swung his laser rapier though the air and gave Ashley and Meg a rascally wink.&lt;br />\u201cYou should watch your asses, ladies,\u201d Jake said. \u201cEveryone else here is.\u201d And with that he leapt off again, looking for more damsels in distress.&lt;br />Ashley feigned offense and turned to Meg.&lt;br />\u201cThat was uncalled for!\u201d&lt;br />Meg smiled and fired her weapon.&lt;br />\u201cYou liked hearing it.\u201d&lt;br />The two girls chatted and chided away, still shooting their laser rifles.&lt;br />Dan looked behind him to check on the underclassmen. He gasped. They were all missing. Where the hell did those kids go?&lt;br />Suddenly, a yell sounded behind him.&lt;br />Sam, Adam, Becky, Jenn Murray, and Sarah Cantler came running over the top of a scrap hill, each swinging pipes. Sarah knocked out a soldier, caught a glimpse of Pat on the far side of the field, and charged towards him. Jenn and Becky formed a small unit and tore into the middle of the fray, swinging energy batons. Sam and Adam slowly waded through the carnage, swinging madly and singing show tunes.&lt;br />Dan shouted angrily at them.&lt;br />\u201cYou were supposed to stay behind the shield! It\u2019s dangerous out here! And what about Steph?\u201d&lt;br />No sooner had these words left his mouth than a deathbot charged out of nowhere, swung a heavy pincer arm and knocked Dan\u2019s weapon from his grip. With the other pincer arm it lifted him off the ground and threw him into a concrete block.&lt;br />Dan looked dazedly up at the towering engine of destruction rumbling toward him. Its laser canons began to charge. He was too weak to fight back, too weak, even, to move. He knew his time had come. He closed his eyes.&lt;br />Instead of hearing the buzzing zap of the laser guns firing, he heard another rumbling, heavier than that of the deathbot, and then a terrible rending crash. He eyes snapped open. A massive bulldozer had plowed in from the side and collided with the deathbot about to fire at him. The heavy blade of the construction machine smashed into the deathbot and pushed it, clawing and screeching, into a huge mountain of scrap metal. The force of the mammoth machine had all but cut the deathbot in half, and the impact with the scrap heap broke the robot to pieces. The deep, diesel rumble of the bulldozer quieted. Dan was shocked to see Steph Lepine, her arm in a sling, hop down from the vehicle and come trotting over to him. She helped him to stand.&lt;br />\u201cWe can tell it\u2019s dangerous, Dan. And as for me, I\u2019m fine. \u2018Stay behind the shield under guard\u2019 my eye! I\u2019m better off out here!\u201d&lt;br />Dam smiled.&lt;br />\u201cWell I guess you\u2019ve proven me wrong. Let\u2019s go get \u2018em.\u201d He picked up his rifle, handed her a laser pistol which he had in a waist holster, and together they joined the battle.&lt;br />&lt;br />Elsewhere, Steve was fighting valiantly. He clashed with several Umbrella Corp soldiers, tripping one, knocking one out cold with his laser rifle. Then, though the madness of battle, he caught sight of the archfiend Silas Blake. Steve fought his way through the mass of Umbrella Corporation soldiers, finally reaching his foe. He aimed his laser rifle at Silas\u2019s chest. Silas held his laser rifle at shoulder level, targeting Steve\u2019s head. The opponents stood staring at each other, breathing heavily.&lt;br />\u201cWell, Steve, what a surprise,\u201d said Silas. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came.\u201d&lt;br />Steve smiled right back. \u201cYou know me, I wouldn\u2019t miss a party.\u201d&lt;br />Silas chuckled. \u201cIt seems we\u2019ve got a stand-off on our hands.\u201d He paused. \u201cWhat\u2019s say we make this more interesting? How about a game of catch?\u201d&lt;br />Silas slowly lowered his rifle. He produced a box of matches from a pouch on his combat belt. Steve lowered his rifle as well.&lt;br />Silas drew a match from the box. \u201cYou ready?\u201d&lt;br />Steve nodded. \u201cI was born so.\u201d&lt;br />Silas quickly lit the match. It flared brightly for an instant and then settled into a slow burn. In a flash he threw the match at Steve, who deftly caught it and blew it out. Silas nodded appreciatively. Now it was Steve\u2019s turn. He drew out his own box of matches, and, to raise the stakes, a bottle of lighter fluid. He doused the box of matches with the butane, struck one match, and lit the whole box. Steve flew the flaming box straight at Silas\u2019 head. Silas dodged out of the way, spun around, and caught the box. Instantly he flung the fiery ball back at Steve. Steve swatted the box back at Silas and a volley developed, from Steve to Silas, Silas to Steve. Inevitably, one slipped up. Steve sent the flaming bundle flying through the air faster than the fiend could counter. The fiery box of matches struck Silas in the chest, bounced off, and fell to the ground. Silas brushed ashes off of his black body armor and angrily stamped on the box of matches, extinguishing it. He glared at Steve.&lt;br />\u201cCareful there, amigo,\u201d Steve quipped, \u201cYou play with matches, you might get burned.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou think you\u2019re skilled?\u201d Silas asked him. \u201cLet\u2019s take the game up another notch.\u201d&lt;br />He bent down and poured lighter fluid liberally over two sharp pieces of metal. He pulled out a Zippo lighter and with a clink-flick, ignited them both. Silas picked them up, one in each hand, and sent the shards of flaming metal whirling at Steve.&lt;br />Steve dodged one and caught the other. He flung the piece of metal at Silas like a Frisbee and smiled in satisfaction. His smile was premature, however, for Silas was ready. He also caught the metal shard and threw it back at Steve with devastating accuracy. Steve dodged out of the missile\u2019s path, but was too slow. The shard grazed his arm. Steve fell to the ground clutching the wound. Silas strode over to him.&lt;br />\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Steve? Get burned?\u201d&lt;br />Steve managed a tight smile.&lt;br />\u201cThe game isn\u2019t over, Silas.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cExcellent!\u201d Silas returned to his place for the continuation of the match. Steve stopped nursing his arm, picked up a pipe, doused one end in butane, and lit it. He flipped it into the air, the flames creating a heavy whirring sound. Closing his eyes, Steve reached out and caught the unlit end of the pipe. Quick as a wink he sent it spinning at Silas. Silas reached out to catch the pipe, but misjudged and caught the flaming end. His gloves were flame retardant, but the heat still reached his tensed fingers. Silas gasped in pain and dropped the pipe. He doubled over, clutching at his wrist.&lt;br />Steve ran toward his foe and leaped into the air, colliding with Silas and sending them both rolling to the earth.&lt;br />The two combatants struggled on the ground, trading punches. Steve managed to position himself on top of Silas. He brushed one of Blake\u2019s punches away and struck him squarely in the face. Silas\u2019 face went slack. His eyes rolled up. He collapsed, unconscious. Steve staggered to his feet and dusted himself off.&lt;br />\u201cGame set and match.\u201d Steve said as he turned away.&lt;br />Silas\u2019 eyes snapped open. He grabbed the bottle of butane and pulled out his lighter.&lt;br />\u201cHey!\u201d&lt;br />His call got Steve\u2019s attention and as he turned, Silas sprayed his chest with a blast of lighter fluid. Before Steve even had time to react, Silas flicked open his lighter and lit the stream of butane. The front of Steve\u2019s shirt went up in a whoosh of flame. He immediately dropped to the ground and rolled on his chest, extinguishing the fire before it had done any serious damage. Silas got up and strode over to where Steve was lying motionless on the ground. Steve slowly lifted himself off the ground as if doing a push up. Silas grinned as he delivered a vicious kick to Steve\u2019s face, sending him toppling backward and knocking him out.&lt;br />Silas drew a knife from a sheath on his combat belt. He squatted down near Steve\u2019s unconscious form. Silas smiled wickedly and was about to finish Steve off when a blast from a laser rifle whizzed past his head. He dropped the knife and whirled around.&lt;br />Amy charged over the muddy terrain towards the two boys, firing her weapon with reckless abandon. Silas decided not to tempt his luck. He darted around a heap of scrap metal and ran.&lt;br />Amy made it to Steve, dropped her laser rifle, and knelt beside him, cradling his head in her arms. Steve blinked tiredly up at her.&lt;br />\u201cThanks a lot, Ames. It was getting dangerous.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cDid he hurt you, Steve?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell, there was some healthy give and take on both sides, but yeah he burned me pretty well at the end there.\u201d&lt;br />He gazed down at his red, blistered chest.&lt;br />Amy stood up, grabbed her laser rifle and started off after Silas.&lt;br />Steve held up a hand.&lt;br />\u201cWait, Amy, what are you doing?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cFirst Tony, then Andrew, now you. Who knows who he\u2019ll hurt next? You three got lucky. Maybe the next person he attacks won\u2019t make it out alive. He\u2019s got to be stopped!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cAmy, no! You don\u2019t understand,\u201d breathed Steve, \u201cHe\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d&lt;br />But his words had fallen on deaf ears. Amy had turned her back and was trotting away after the fiend Silas Blake.&lt;br />&lt;br />Tony gritted his teeth in pain as he tied his belt around his leg above the wound inflicted by Silas. He was still sitting behind a cluster of oil drums on the edge of the melee. He grabbed his sword and tried to stand-up. The pain in his leg was too great, and he collapsed to the ground again. He was cursing his weakness when a sound behind him made him turn around.&lt;br />A deathbot and ten UC soldiers had found his hiding place. They stood looking down at him through their glowing red eyes. The soldiers raised their weapons and prepared to fire when a crash behind them made them turn violently.&lt;br />Two gleaming black Mercedes had crashed through the heavy gates of the scrap yard. The luxury cars came to a halt near the other line of vehicles and their doors opened.&lt;br />Tony, watching from across the battle, couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. Eight men emerged from the cars, some dressed in silvery Armani jackets and pants, others in obnoxious tracksuits. All carried aluminum baseball bats. One man stood out from all the others. He had slick, black hair and wore a black suit which seemed tailor fit to his powerful frame. His dark eyes glinted dangerous as he scanned the scene in front of him.&lt;br />It was Tony\u2019s father.&lt;br />His eyes came to rest on his son, bleeding and surrounded across the fray, and with an emphatic gesture, he and the other Italian gentlemen marched toward the boy.&lt;br />The leader of the small band of soldiers stepped forward to meet Mr. Celi.&lt;br />\u201cHey, pops, what are you and these other Scorcese rejects doing here?\u201d&lt;br />Mr. Celi kept his calm.&lt;br />\u201cWe\u2019re here to help my son and his friends, whom you seem intent on doing harm to.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cOh yeah?\u201d asked the soldier. \u201cWell these little punks are getting what they deserve. They----\u201d&lt;br />He got no farther. Mr. Celi had laid him out flat with a swing from his Louisville Slugger. At that signal, the other wise guys began in earnest, bringing their own type of retribution to the UC goons, and even striking bravely out at the deathbot.&lt;br />Mr. Celi helped Tony up and hugged him tightly.&lt;br />\u201cDad,\u201d Tony asked, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cDidn\u2019t that mutt in the face mask just ask me the same thing?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSeriously, Dad.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cABC Storage is just 2 minutes from here. I heard about what was goin\u2019 on from a friend of a friend and decided to come and help you guys out.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThanks, we need it.\u201d Tony gripped his sword. His father saw this and frowned.&lt;br />\u201cTony, a nice Italian boy like you, messin\u2019 around with those things. It isn\u2019t right.\u201d He called to one of his men. \u201cJoe, gimme that extra bat.\u201d&lt;br />The Mafioso in question, a hulking beast in a red tracksuit, handed the weapon to Mr. Celi.&lt;br />\u201cHere, Tones, use this.\u201d&lt;br />Tony took the sword in one hand and the bat in the other, smiled, and with a departing \u201cThanks,\u201d limped into the fray.&lt;br />&lt;br />Amy followed the fleeing Silas far across the compound, to the door of a large machinery room near the trash compactor. Silas took one look back at the towering beauty pursuing him, a rifle in her hand and rage in her eyes, and dashed through the large door into the clanking darkness. Amy reached the door, stopped, and peered inside. She could make out nothing. Steeling herself up, she gripped the rifle tightly and stepped inside. Suddenly several dim bulbs burst into life. Amy blinked dazedly as her eyes became adjusted to the dull, yellow light. She looked around. The room was filled with massive pieces of machinery, whirring and clanking obnoxiously. It seemed to be a power plant, generating energy for the surrounding factories. Just as the noise was becoming maddening, it began to cease. Gradually the noise vanished entirely. Amy glanced to her right. Blake was seated on some sort of generator, his hand slowly slipping off a switch. He had cut the power to the machinery.&lt;br />\u201cGlad you showed up. You caught my eye on the battlefield today and I so desired to meet up with you . . .\u201d he slid off the generator and moved across the floor to her, \u201cface to face.\u201d&lt;br />The barrel of Amy\u2019s laser rifle was now jabbing into Silas\u2019 taught stomach, yet he moved closer still.&lt;br />\u201cWhat are you doing here, smart girl like you?\u201d&lt;br />Amy was momentarily mesmerized by Blake\u2019s sea green eyes, but snapped herself out of it.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019m here to fight Umbrella.\u201d&lt;br />Silas began to wander around the engine room. Amy, almost involuntarily, let her gaze wander over his lithe, shapely frame. She nodded in approval, caught herself, and gripped her laser rifle more tightly.&lt;br />\u201cI know that much, Amy,\u201d Silas said. \u201cBut why are you really here?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell, I first encountered Umbrella with Rich, going to get Andrew.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI see.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThen they went after me when I was with Rich and Andrew at a sex shop.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThat was a fun one.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cToday I\u2019m here to help Rich.\u201d&lt;br />Silas turned to look at her.&lt;br />\u201cSo, basically you\u2019re here today, as you were every other time, because of the needs of someone else.\u201d&lt;br />Amy lowered her rifle.&lt;br />\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be here. You strike me as more of the fun-loving type. That leads to the inevitable question: What do you do for fun?\u201d&lt;br />Her eyes locked with his and a shiver went down the length of her spine.&lt;br />Silas stepped forward. He licked his full, pink lips.&lt;br />\u201cYou don\u2019t want this; you have no part in it. Forget the battle outside. Forget the people scrambling over and around each other for two needless causes. Just focus on you and me. What do you say?\u201d&lt;br />Amy\u2019s lip quivered. The laser rifle dropped from her grasp. Silas, no less than three inches from her supple breasts, smiled. He spoke, his voice deep and gravelly.&lt;br />\u201cWanna have some fun?\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />Rich was fighting several enemy soldiers when he caught sight of Steve. Dispatching two with powerful swings of his fists, Richard tore the rifle out of the hands of the remaining third and, turning the weapon\u2019s dial to stun, shot the goon in the stomach, knocking him out. He ran to Steve and pulled him to his feet.&lt;br />\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a long and interesting story,\u201d Steve began.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019ll take the abbreviated version, if you please.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell, Silas lit me on fire and would have sliced me up had Amy not showed up and scared him off. She then took of after him. Kind of a rash move, if you ask me.\u201d&lt;br />Richard let go of Steve, who promptly collapsed again. He rubbed his brow worriedly.&lt;br />\u201cThis is not good, Steve.\u201d Rich said. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna get hurt.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThat\u2019s what I told her. I said, \u2018Wait, Amy, he\u2019s too dangerous.\u2019 But would she listen? No! Well, makes sense I suppose. Women are only a third as smart as men.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSteve!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWhat? It\u2019s science.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNo, I need to go after Amy. I need to save her. You need to go get Tony and Andrew and find us. I have a feeling I\u2019ll need back up.\u201d&lt;br />And with that, Richard took off.&lt;br />Steve raised a feeble hand.&lt;br />\u201cNo, Rich, not by yourself! He\u2019s too dangerous!\u201d&lt;br />But Richard was already long gone.&lt;br />\u201cDamn,\u201d said Steve dejectedly. \u201cI\u2019m really not good at that.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />Tony was battering and slashing a deathbot alongside Pawel, EJ, and Marissa. The heroes fought with courage and intensity, but to little avail. The robotic beast was invulnerable to their attacks.&lt;br />Steve ran up and tapped Tony on the shoulder.&lt;br />\u201cWhat is it, Steve?\u201d Tony asked, dodging a blow from one of the deathbots heavy arms. \u201cI\u2019m a bit busy.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cRich needs our help. He\u2019s fighting Silas to save Amy.\u201d&lt;br />Tony stopped fighting. \u201cRich? Trouble? Amy? Needs saving? Silas?\u201d He practically spat the last word. It was plain to see he was dying for a rematch. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />Tony and Steve came upon Andrew\u2019s sprawled form. They rushed forward, dismay on their faces. Andrew lay on his back, the knife from Silas still sticking upward out of his stomach. He wasn\u2019t moving.&lt;br />\u201cDamnit! No!\u201d Steve yelled.&lt;br />\u201cThis can\u2019t be!\u201d Tony cried.&lt;br />Both boys knelt near Andrew, both on the verge of tears.&lt;br />Steve shook his lanky friend.&lt;br />\u201cWake up, you bastard! Don\u2019t let it end like this!\u201d He began to cry.&lt;br />Tony sat in stony silence to the side.&lt;br />Suddenly, Andrew sat up.&lt;br />Both Steve and Tony screamed and leaped into each other\u2019s arms.&lt;br />Andrew examined his wound. He pulled the knife out of his stomach without flinching and threw it aside. He then rolled up his orange spandex combat suit.&lt;br />\u201cAww, man,\u201d he cried, pulling out several crumbled items from inside the shirt.&lt;br />\u201cThat jerk punctured my Capri Sun and broke it spilled all over my Combos! Then he twisted the freakin\u2019 blade and broke all those delicious little pretzels to pieces! Damnit! It\u2019s all just a paste now. Well, no choice but to eat it.\u201d&lt;br />Andrew sat gobbling up the juice-soaked pretzel mush with a look of delight on his face.&lt;br />Tony and Steve found speech.&lt;br />\u201cYou jerk!\u201d Tony shouted. \u201cWe thought you were dead!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYeah, where do you get off hidin\u2019 food under your combat suit!?\u201d&lt;br />Andrew glanced up at them.&lt;br />\u201cJeez, you chicken fries need to get a grip.\u201d&lt;br />Steve and Tony roughly hauled Andrew to his feet. Only concern for Richard and Amy kept them from beating him severely. They dragged their lanky friend, who was still eating the pretzel mush, toward Amy and Richard\u2019s last known location, explaining the mission on the way.&lt;br />&lt;br />Richard stepped up to the very same doorway Amy had stopped in front of twenty minutes ago. He clutched his laser pistol, took a deep breath, and stepped inside.&lt;br />He gasped aloud at the sight in front of him.&lt;br />Amy, stripped of her armor and combat suit, wearing nothing but bra and panties, was lying on her back on a broad, flat piece of machinery. In fact, she was tied to it. Silas was sitting on the machine beside her, running the blade of a small knife down her smooth stomach.&lt;br />\u201cSilas stop!\u201d Richard yelled, pointing his laser pistol at the maniac\u2019s chest.&lt;br />Silas merely grinned.&lt;br />\u201cMy, my. Amy, we just can\u2019t seem to get any privacy.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cLet her go, Silas!\u201d Richard growled.&lt;br />\u201cOh, spare me the heroics, Richard,\u201d said Silas. \u201cI know you too well.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou know exactly what I mean. You can stand there acting the dashing and chivalrous knight, but you\u2019re just as deranged as me.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019m nothing like you, you bastard!\u201d&lt;br />Silas laughed, a light, merry sound. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d&lt;br />Richard started forward, his eyes blazing, his jaw tight.&lt;br />Silas moved the knife to Amy\u2019s throat and applied just enough pressure to the soft flesh to draw a drop of blood.&lt;br />\u201cStop right there, hero. Drop your weapon and hear me out.\u201d&lt;br />Richard stopped in his tracks, let his laser pistol fall to the ground, but his eyes still glinted with a barely restrained fury.&lt;br />Silas smiled, and relaxed slightly, but kept the blade at Amy\u2019s neck.&lt;br />\u201cGood boy.\u201d He paused, seemed to collect his thoughts, and then began.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019ve read your blog. I\u2019ve read your file. I know you well. All your ins and outs, so to speak. I know what you\u2019re thinking right now. You don\u2019t want to save Amy. No. You just want her. Deny it, if you can. From the moment when you first saw her you\u2019ve desired her more than anything else. I can see it in your eyes now. Step forward, take advantage of her vulnerability.\u201d&lt;br />Richard stood his ground.&lt;br />Silas lost his temper.&lt;br />\u201cHypocrite! You, with all your fetishes and perversions. Don\u2019t act noble now!\u201d&lt;br />Richard still wouldn\u2019t move.&lt;br />\u201cC\u2019mon. Indulge in those fetishes.\u201d&lt;br />He moved slowly, smoothly, from near Amy\u2019s neck to down by her bare feet.&lt;br />\u201cLook, I\u2019ll get her warmed up for you.\u201d&lt;br />He slid his tongue out and gently licked her toes. Amy squirmed.&lt;br />\u201cDamnit, Silas! Stop this!\u201d Richard yelled.&lt;br />Silas lost his temper again.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019ll make you do this!\u201d He tickled her big toe with the tip of his blade. \u201cMaybe I just start chopping these beautiful toes off, one . . . by . . . one, until you give in.\u201d&lt;br />Richard could take it no longer. He\u2019d have to outwit Silas.&lt;br />\u201cListen, Blake. You don\u2019t want Amy. Enticing as she is, you know whom you really want. Me.\u201d&lt;br />Blake looked up.&lt;br />\u201cI see the way you look at me. You don\u2019t care about anybody else. Let the girl go, Silas.\u201d&lt;br />Blake stood up.&lt;br />\u201cI don\u2019t need the girl,\u201d he whispered. He locked eyes with Richard. \u201cI don\u2019t need the girl!\u201d Yelling this time.&lt;br />He advanced on Richard, holding his knife.&lt;br />\u201cYou don\u2019t need the knife to beat me. You want to fight me face to face, hand to hand.\u201d&lt;br />Silas\u2019 face twisted in strange near-orgasmic contortions.&lt;br />\u201cI don\u2019t need the knife, Rich. I don\u2019t need the knife!\u201d&lt;br />He threw the knife across the room.&lt;br />\u201cNow,\u201d said Richard, \u201cLet\u2019s settle this!\u201d&lt;br />Silas started forward, but stopped.&lt;br />\u201cAh, but how?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell, you bested Tony in swordsmanship, Andrew in racing, Steve in pyromania, and Amy in seduction. Unless you can compose a short story in 15 minutes we\u2019ve got no common ground. I don\u2019t have any practical or applicable talents.\u201d&lt;br />Silas rolled up the sleeve of his combat suit.&lt;br />\u201cWanna arm wrestle?\u201d&lt;br />Richard couldn\u2019t help smiling. Silas was fit, to be sure, but as far as brute strength was concerned he couldn\u2019t see the contest being very even.&lt;br />\u201cSure.\u201d&lt;br />They positioned themselves on either side of another flat piece of machinery, like the one Amy was currently strapped to. They gripped hands tightly, fiercely. Silas nodded.&lt;br />\u201cBegin.\u201d&lt;br />From the start, Richard was amazed at how deceptive Silas\u2019 thin frame was. He managed to match Richard in strength, seemingly without effort. Minutes past and neither opponent gave an inch. Sweat began to bead on their brows. Then, through gritted teeth, Silas spoke.&lt;br />\u201cYou know, I was watching a Victoria\u2019s Secret commercial a little while ago, and I was just about aroused enough to begin masturbating when who pops up but Bob Dylan.\u201d&lt;br />Richard lost his concentration for a moment and Silas gained a few inches. What the hell was this maniac doing?&lt;br />Silas continued.&lt;br />\u201cYou can imagine how that ruined my experience. I mean, what were the advertisers thinking? Whenever I think hot women in lingerie, I think aging folk singer.\u201d&lt;br />Richard lost a few more inches as he chuckled. He realized what Silas was doing: He was telling jokes.&lt;br />\u201cWhat is more, Bob Dylan didn\u2019t even look like a folk singer. He looked like a cartoon villain. He was dressed in a flowery, dark suit, he had a devil beard, and he just spent the ad glowering at the models. I expected him to tie one of them to some train tracks and start laughing maniacally.\u201d&lt;br />Richard laughed again. He couldn\u2019t continue like this.&lt;br />He could, however, joke right back at him.&lt;br />\u201cI was thinking to myself, a little while ago, how would it be possible to make baseball more interesting. I got a few ideas which fizzled out, but then I hit on it: A monkey gun!\u201d&lt;br />Silas chuckled, and Richard regained some inches.&lt;br />\u201cI don\u2019t mean a gun that shoots monkeys, no, that\u2019s no fun. I mean a gun that fires monkeys out of itself. A monkey-launcher.\u201d&lt;br />Silas let out a loud, full guffaw, and the hands went back to being even.&lt;br />\u201cOh no, I\u2019m gonna miss that ball. Monkey go!\u201d&lt;br />Silas laughed again, and Richard pushed the villain\u2019s hand down, almost all the way to the surface of the machine they were competing on.&lt;br />For what seemed like hours, the two boys traded jokes, hands gripping each other so tightly that the knuckles became white. Their stomachs were in fiery agony from the combined effort of holding back laughter and holding back each other\u2019s powerful levering.&lt;br />Finally, Silas found Rich\u2019s weakness.&lt;br />\u201cSo, I used to roof summers. I gotta say, the characters you meet roofing are like no others. Always full of stories about their wives, ex-wives, illegitimate children, parole officers, drug dealers . . .\u201d&lt;br />Richard almost lost it at this point. Silas was telling his jokes!&lt;br />\u201cThey\u2019re not too bright, though. They smoked a lot of pot . . . on the roof.\u201d&lt;br />Richard couldn\u2019t help himself. He began to laugh. As Silas continued the jokes Richard himself had written, Richard\u2019s grip loosened, his hand slipped. Finally his wrist and knuckles slammed down onto the machine. Without wasting a moment, Silas struck him in the face, sending him tumbling onto the floor. Richard massaged his wrist and stared up at Silas.&lt;br />\u201cHow did you . . . ?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI won because I knew your weakness. You laugh the most at your own material, you conceited fool.\u201d He strode over to Amy and began to trace her body with his fingertips. \u201cNow, back to the task at hand.\u201d&lt;br />Richard feared the worst, when suddenly Steve, Tony, and Andrew rushed into the room, laser rifles aimed and ready. Silas froze. Tony ran forward and helped Richard up.&lt;br />Silas\u2019 hand was quick to move to Amy\u2019s throat. He tightened his grip around her soft neck.&lt;br />\u201cRichard, you should know better.\u201d Silas sighed. \u201cWe can go on in this hostage-bargain pattern for hours. You and your friends can\u2019t beat me. You\u2019ve tried. Now, discard those blasted laser guns, and kick them over here.&lt;br />The heroes did as Silas ordered, and the villain stooped to pick up one of the rifles. He turned from Amy and aimed the weapon at Richard and his friends.&lt;br />\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthat was your first mistake. Now I wonder which of you I should kill first . . .\u201d&lt;br />Richard had to think fast. Silas would kill them all if he couldn\u2019t figure out a way to trick him. Suddenly, he was struck by an idea.&lt;br />\u201cSilas, no. Don\u2019t kill us yet. Pretty please. Not when there\u2019s so much more you could do to us.\u201d&lt;br />He had peaked Silas\u2019 interested. Blake lowered the laser rifle and cocked an eyebrow.&lt;br />\u201cOh? Care to elaborate?\u201d&lt;br />Richard spoke to his friends out of the side of his mouth while continuing to smile at Silas.&lt;br />\u201cBlake is a darker version of myself, in many ways. He has many of the same desires, but none of my control. We can use that. Just follow my lead.\u201d&lt;br />Richard stepped forward and began to remove his armor. He then pulled off his shirt. Silas gaped.&lt;br />\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to guess where I\u2019m going, Silas. Think about it, four attractive teenage boys, undressing and at your mercy.\u201d&lt;br />He glanced behind him at his friends, shuffling their feet and looking confused. He gave them a meaningful look.&lt;br />Steve was the first to play along. With a muttered \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he dropped his pants and stood next to Richard. Tony and Andrew relented as well, and began to undress.&lt;br />Silas smiled like an eager child as he gazed at the four almost-nude boys in front of him. He relaxed the laser rifle and started toward them.&lt;br />He reached Richard and stopped.&lt;br />\u201cWait. You\u2019ve fooled me before, why should I believe you now?\u201d&lt;br />Richard could think of nothing to say.&lt;br />\u201cIn fact, perhaps it would be smarter to simply kill you all.\u201d&lt;br />Richard gulped.&lt;br />\u201cUnless you can prove you\u2019re serious . . .\u201d&lt;br />Richard had no idea what to do. Silas was raising the rifle, about to kill him and his friends. He had to do something. No more thinking, just action. Without even realizing what he was doing, he leaned forward in a rush and kissed Silas full on the mouth. Blake\u2019s eyes widened in shock, then closed in ecstasy. The rifle slipped from his grasp.&lt;br />Behind them, Tony, Andrew, and Steve stood in their boxers in slack-jawed amazement. For what seemed an unnecessarily long time, Richard and Silas stood locked together. Finally they released. Silas smiled and said breathlessly, \u201cYou are a good kisser. So, what shall we do now?\u201d He looked expectantly back and forth.&lt;br />\u201cWell I can think of one thing.\u201d Richard said. He cocked back his fist and slammed Silas directly in the nose. The villain toppled backward onto the floor, unconscious.&lt;br />Tony and Andrew grabbed their laser rifles and guarded Silas. Richard and Steve went over to untie Amy. In a trice they had her unbound and up, nursing her swollen wrists. They were all still stripped down to the undergarments.&lt;br />Amy looked around at her four rescuers.&lt;br />\u201cWe\u2019re all in our underwear,\u201d she observed brightly. \u201cSo . . . what shall we do now?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cCareful, Amy,\u201d Steve warned. \u201cRich has a habit of punching anyone who say that.\u201d&lt;br />The friends all dressed in silence. It was an awkward moment. When they were fully clothed again, they all turned to Silas. He had regained consciousness and was sitting sullenly on the floor.&lt;br />Richard walked over to him, grabbed him by the collar, and lifted him off the ground. He brought his face close to Silas\u2019 and without a word delivered a stunning head butt. Silas\u2019 lip began to bleed freely. Richard dropped him again. He picked up his laser pistol and aimed it at the fiend\u2019s head, point-blank range.&lt;br />\u201cYou tried to kill me. You tried to kill me friends. We got lucky. If you\u2019d have had your way we\u2019d be dead right now. Give me one good reason why I shouldn\u2019t kill you where you sit, and end this. Protect my friends and myself.\u201d&lt;br />Behind him his friends began to raise objections, to plead for him to not kill Blake.&lt;br />\u201cDon\u2019t Rich.\u201d Amy begged. \u201cYou said yourself, \u2018no killing.\u2019\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll agree with Amy,\u201d said Steve. \u201cKeep your principles.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou\u2019re a Catholic, Rich. Think of your beliefs, of the teachings of Jesus.\u201d Andrew reasoned.&lt;br />\u201cKill him,\u201d said Tony.&lt;br />\u201cTony!\u201d yelled the other three in unison.&lt;br />Richard smiled. He paid no heed to his friends\u2019 words.&lt;br />\u201cJust one reason, Blake,\u201d he said.&lt;br />Blake slid to a stand against the beam behind him.&lt;br />\u201cDon\u2019t you at least want to know my plan?\u201d he asked.&lt;br />\u201cYour plan?\u201d said Andrew. \u201cYou mean the plan of that giant head. So Rich tells us.\u201d&lt;br />Silas laughed bitterly.&lt;br />\u201cThat old fool? If he were the one in charge the Umbrella Corporation would go bankrupt.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Amy was saying.&lt;br />Richard scratched his chin thoughtfully.&lt;br />\u201cNo, it makes perfect sense. That old man isn\u2019t the power behind Umbrella. At least, not recently. That explains the changes in the Corporation. The sensible plan, the new efficient corporate ethic.\u201d He looked at Silas. \u201cYou being placed in charge of NP Inc.\u201d&lt;br />Silas grinned.&lt;br />\u201cYou\u2019re catching on. For some time now I have been controlling that doddering old fool with a small brainwashing device. I am effectively the CEO. Of course, I couldn\u2019t take over now. The ideology of the board of directors is still very much in tune with that of the old man. I need to prove that my ideology is better. Once this plan succeeds, and UC has control of the globe through those drugs, then the Doctor will have an unfortunate accident, and I will be the new CEO of the most powerful corporation on the planet. I don\u2019t suppose any of you would like to join me?\u201d&lt;br />The five friends stared at Blake in silence. The sounds of the battle from outside became audible.&lt;br />Silas sighed. \u201cDidn\u2019t think so. Well, now that you know my scheme, will you let me live?\u201d&lt;br />Richard smiled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not, Silas. You\u2019re too dangerous. You need to be killed.\u201d&lt;br />Silas smiled back. \u201cSorry, hero, but I know you won\u2019t kill me.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cOh, really?\u201d Richard stepped forward and shoved the barrel of his laser pistol into Silas\u2019 mouth. \u201cStill so sure about that, Silas? Huh? What have you got to say for yourself now?\u201d&lt;br />Andrew put his hand on Richard\u2019s shoulder. \u201cRich, buddy, don\u2019t do this. This has gone far enough.\u201d&lt;br />Richard spoke to Andrew over his shoulder, his eyes still locked on Silas\u2019.&lt;br />\u201cAndrew, do you remember when you were flirting with Evelyn at the same time I was? When you let me do all the leg work and then stepped in and swept her off her feet, knowing full well that I wanted to date her?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYes,\u201d Andrew said quietly, hesitantly.&lt;br />\u201cThen you haven\u2019t forgotten that little episode?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNo.\u201d&lt;br />Richard turned around, pulling the gun out of Silas\u2019 mouth.&lt;br />\u201cGood,\u201d he said grimly, \u201cneither have I.\u201d&lt;br />Without another word, he shot Andrew in the chest with his pistol at point blank range. The lanky crusader flew backward and crashed to the ground. His chest was smoking and from it issued the smell of burnt meat. The others gasped in horror.&lt;br />Richard turned back around and faced Silas.&lt;br />\u201cWell, what have you got to say now?\u201d&lt;br />Silas broke down.&lt;br />\u201cAnything. I\u2019ll give you anything you want,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWhat could you possibly have to give me?\u201d&lt;br />Silas slowly reached into his combat belt and withdrew several documents.&lt;br />\u201cHere, it\u2019s the ownership papers for Ninja Pirate Inc. The whole company. I don\u2019t care, take it, please.\u201d He withdrew a pen and signed the papers over to Richard. He looked up pleadingly.&lt;br />Richard accepted the papers, smiled, and uncocked his laser pistol. He let Blake slide down to the floor, breathing deeply. Without a word he walked over to Andrew. Richard knelt down near his friend and gently rubbed his face.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019m sorry I had to do that,\u201d he said.&lt;br />Then, to the surprise of everyone in the room, he slapped him.&lt;br />\u201cGet up, you drama queen.\u201d&lt;br />Andrew stirred awake. He rubbed his chest. A sigh of relief issued from the three onlookers. Silas stared in disbelief.&lt;br />\u201cOww. That hurt.\u201d Once again he rolled up his spandex combat shirt, this time revealing a slightly abused bagel melt. He pulled the sandwich off his chest and observed it keenly.&lt;br />\u201cHey, you heated up my ham, egg, and cheese sandwich. The cheese is melted perfectly. You burnt the ham, though.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSorry, amigo,\u201d said Richard, smiling, \u201cbut stun is the lowest setting on this ol\u2019 blaster.\u201d&lt;br />Steve opened and closed his mouth silently several times before finally speaking. \u201cRich, what the hell just happened?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI love you guys,\u201d said Rich. \u201cSo concerned for my soul. I was never going to kill this bastard,\u201d he said, indicating Silas. \u201cI just wanted to see how much he would give me if he was genuinely scared. I set the laser on stun, and I knew full well that Andrew had a sandwich under his shirt. What kind of friend would I be if I didn\u2019t? It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d&lt;br />Amy looked stunned, as did Steve. Silas looked furious. Andrew bit into his sandwich. Tony laughed.&lt;br />\u201cWell done, Ricardo, well done!\u201d He patted Richard on the back. \u201cBut the question still remains, what to do with Silas?\u201d&lt;br />Richard grinned. \u201cOh, I can think of a few things.\u201d&lt;br />What those things were was never revealed, for at that moment, Cap\u2019n Adolph Lenin Huzuki-bot 3500 came charging through the doorway. It wasn\u2019t quite big enough to accommodate him, so he broke off several girders and bits of brick on his way in.&lt;br />In a flash, he disarmed the gathered heroes and helped Silas Blake to his feet. The Cap\u2019n had an array of laser weaponry on is hulking metal body, and he targeted each of the friends with several guns.&lt;br />\u201cWell, done, Cap\u2019n.\u201d Silas said. \u201cI may not trade you in for scrap metal after all.\u201d&lt;br />Silas then strode over to Richard.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019ve owe you a good deal, hero,\u201d he said, smiling wickedly. Without another word he punched Richard in the face. Richard moved to hit back, but Silas held up a hand.&lt;br />\u201cNo!\u201d he yelled.&lt;br />Richard stopped.&lt;br />\u201cSo that\u2019s how you do that,\u201d Steve muttered to himself.&lt;br />\u201cTouch me and I have the Cap\u2019n vaporize your little friends, one limb at a time.\u201d Silas threatened. \u201cYou just stand there and take your punishment like a good boy. Now, where was I? Oh yeah. This is for trying to foil my plans.\u201d&lt;br />Silas spun gracefully and kicked Richard in the face.&lt;br />\u201cThis is for causing me so much trouble.\u201d&lt;br />He punched him in the stomach.&lt;br />\u201cThis is for hitting me after we kissed.\u201d&lt;br />A head-butt. \u201cThat\u2019s for hitting me when I was unarmed and unready.\u201d&lt;br />A punch to the face. Richard fell to the ground.&lt;br />\u201cThis is for threatening to kill me.\u201d&lt;br />Silas kicked his enemy in the stomach as he lay on the floor.&lt;br />Richard\u2019s friends watched in helpless frustration as Silas rained blows upon their comrade, kicking him mercilessly as he rolled in pain on the ground.&lt;br />\u201cThis is for making me sign over Ninja Pirate Inc.\u201d&lt;br />He grabbed Richard by his long hair smashed his face on the floor.&lt;br />\u201cThis is for scaring me so badly.\u201d&lt;br />He kneed Richard in the groin.&lt;br />Then, as Richard was doubled over in pain, he slapped him in the face.&lt;br />\u201cAnd that . . .\u201d Silas paused for breath, exhausted from the beating he delivered, \u201cthat was for toying with by emotions.\u201d&lt;br />He stooped to pick up Richard\u2019s dropped laser pistol. He forced it into Richard\u2019s mouth.&lt;br />\u201cI owe you one last one. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s set to \u201cstun,\u201d so it probably won\u2019t kill you. Sure, you\u2019ll go through life a catatonic vegetable, but at least you\u2019ll still have your health.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWhat have you got to say for yourself now?\u201d&lt;br />Richard looked at him through one half-shut eye. The other was swollen closed.&lt;br />\u201cHuh? What have you got to say---?\u201d&lt;br />Silas got no farther. Some unseen force had pulled him off of Richard and sent him flying across the room, where he crashed against the wall, and lay motionless.&lt;br />Richard looked up at his savior. And up. And up. The creature that had come to his rescue had to be at least 10 feet tall, Richard thought.&lt;br />Cap\u2019n Adolph Lenin Huzuki-bot 3500 stooped and gently picked Richard up in his monstrous arms.&lt;br />\u201cZair, zair, sonny. It\u2019s all over now,\u201d he said quietly.&lt;br />He brought Richard over to his friends, but did not put him down.&lt;br />Tony stepped forward.&lt;br />\u201cThank you, so much, Cap\u2019n. But why did you do it?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cGarsh,\u201d said the Cap\u2019n. \u201cI never wanted to hurt you kids. I\u2019m part robot, comrades, an\u2019 I were just forrowin\u2019 me programmin\u2019. On top a zat, I also be part Nazi, and part Communist, and part zombie. Zo evil kinder came natural, I guess. Just now, zough, I learlized what I was part of. The Breller Corporation an\u2019 all. Too much evil. I decided to help yer out. Zeemed ze least I could do.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell, thank you no matter what you\u2019re reasons. You saved our friend. Hell, you saved all of us,\u201d said Amy.&lt;br />\u201cNow, let\u2019s get out of here,\u201d said Steve.&lt;br />\u201cSure thing,\u201d said Tony. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget about Silas, though.\u201d&lt;br />They all looked over to the wall which Silas had smashed into.&lt;br />The maniac was gone.&lt;br />&lt;br />Even the dim grey light of the day seemed dazzlingly bright as the five, no, now 6, heroes trudged wearily out of the generator room. They made their way back to the battlefield, slowly navigating the path around mountains of scrap metal and old machinery. When they finally reached the carnage left over from the epic fight, they were too tired to be shocked. They did all managed weary smiles, though. The heroes had won. The ground was strewn with the unconscious forms of nearly one hundred Umbrella Corporation soldiers. Also evident was the wreckage of two deathbots. The other two were mysteriously missing. The bodies of several of their friends, unconscious or wounded, lay near the row of cars. There had amazingly been no fatalities. Dan caught sight of them first. His smile soon vanished as he saw the Cap\u2019n hulking along behind them, still carrying Richard. He ran toward the small party, laser rifle aimed and ready.&lt;br />\u201cLook out, you guys!\u201d he warned. \u201cThe enemy\u2019s right behind you!\u201d&lt;br />Tony walked up to Dan.&lt;br />\u201cIt\u2019s cool. He\u2019s on our side, now. Long story.\u201d&lt;br />And with that, they all made it back to the line of cars.&lt;br />&lt;br />As the six heroes walked along (The Cap\u2019n was still carrying Rich), Tony spoke with Dan.&lt;br />\u201cSo what finally turned the tide of battle?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cIt was a matter of morale, I think,\u201d Dan responded thoughtfully. \u201cWith two deathbots destroyed and the other two apparently vanished, the game got a good deal more even. Plus, the Cap\u2019n here never actually fought. And Silas took off after lighting Steve on fire.\u201d&lt;br />Steve stared ruefully at his burned torso.&lt;br />\u201cAh, my beautiful giant ab, it\u2019s been hurt.\u201d&lt;br />Dan went on. \u201cThen, the arrival of Tony\u2019s dad and the other mobsters---\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThey\u2019re legitimate businessmen,\u201d interjected Tony.&lt;br />\u201cBe that as it may, when they showed up, and the underclassmen disobeyed my orders and joined the fray, that pretty much clinched the thing right there.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cJesus, we sure did a lot of damage,\u201d breathed Amy, surveying the catastrophic scene.&lt;br />\u201cYeah, it was one hell of a fracas, alright,\u201d remarked Dan. \u201cBut miraculously enough, not one fatality.\u201d He paused. \u201cOf course, that leaves us with another huge problem. Namely, what to do with these guys.\u201d Dan waved his hand over the battleground, indicating the five score Umbrella Corp soldiers lying unconscious in the mud and scrap metal. \u201cI think it\u2019s best not to get the police involved, so no jail. But we can\u2019t leave them here, and we can\u2019t very well kill them.\u201d&lt;br />The Cap\u2019n stepped forward.&lt;br />\u201cI could help yer on zat one, comrade. Ninja Pirate Inc has its own small army of robots, and several large underground holding cells. I could call for a team to get here and----\u201d he broke off.&lt;br />\u201c\u2019Course, I\u2019m probably fired by now. Silas is still in charge of NP Inc, and it\u2019s still tied to Umbrella,\u201d he said sadly.&lt;br />\u201cActually, Cap\u2019n,\u201d said Rich groggily, \u201cyou\u2019re wrong on that count.\u201d He pulled the documents out of his pocket. \u201cWe own Ninja Pirate Incorporated, and its ties to Umbrella are officially severed.\u201d He looked into the Cap\u2019n\u2019s big, brown eye. \u201cSo, how\u2019d you like your old job back?\u201d&lt;br />The Cap\u2019n beamed down at his one-time foe. \u201cAwww. I\u2019d love zat more\u2019n all ze gold in Gibralter,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s all ze same ter you, me little comrade, I\u2019d rather be reinstated in an advisory position.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWhatever you want, Cap\u2019n,\u201d said Tony. \u201cThough we\u2019ll naturally have to delete your Nazi and Communist components.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cGood riddance,\u201d said the Cap\u2019n. \u201cI never liked those, anyway. You can get rid of zem now, if yer wish.\u201d The Cap\u2019n knelt down in facing away from the group, and a panel opened on his broad back. Steve and Tony reached in and removed several disks labeled \u201cNazi,\u201d \u201cCommie,\u201d and \u201cEvil.\u201d Tony handed them to the Cap\u2019n, who transferred Rich to one hand, and, with the other snapped the disks to pieces.&lt;br />\u201cYarr. That feels much better. What a rerief.\u201d&lt;br />Tony reached into the panel again and punched several buttons on a small keypad located within. He did some creative re-wiring, closed the panel, and stood back.&lt;br />\u201cThere. Now you\u2019ll alternate between pirate and Japanese accents. It\u2019ll be less confusing that way.\u201d&lt;br />The Cap\u2019n nodded. Then he stood up and turned to Dan.&lt;br />\u201cNow, if yer\u2019ll simply call one a yer mates over an\u2019 instruct \u2018im to round up them scurvy seabiscuits, I\u2019ll call in a task force from NP Inc.\u201d&lt;br />Dan agreed and signaled for Caitlin to come over.&lt;br />She had taken the football helmet off and let her brown hair down. It flowed gently in the wind. Her cheeks were still flushed from the excitement of battle and her eyes were bright. She had a small cut on one cheek. Looking from behind the Cap\u2019n\u2019s bulky arms, Richard was stunned by how beautiful she looked.&lt;br />Dan, it seemed, was also speechless from the glorious sight, but found words soon enough.&lt;br />\u201cCait, would you please gather some people together and round up the UC troops?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSure thing, Commander,\u201d she said, giving Dan a smart salute.&lt;br />\u201cThere should be plenty of rope in the Falcon to tie them up with,\u201d Richard said. She nodded and left. Richard remarked to her back, \u201cMaybe there\u2019ll even be enough extra for you to tie me up.\u201d&lt;br />The Cap\u2019n overheard this and chuckled.&lt;br />\u201cYer\u2019ll need to be smoother than that, me \u2018earty, to win a beauty like that.\u201d&lt;br />Rich nodded and promptly passed out.&lt;br />&lt;br />When he awoke, Caitlin was leading a large group of combined students and wise guys to gather together the enemy soldiers and tie them to each other in groups of five. Other students were tending to the injuries of their comrades, under the direction of Steve, and Mafioso doctor Louis \u201cthe Doc\u201d Lapiozzo. Still other assorted groups of students were bustling about collecting weapons and armor off the field, and repairing cars. Richard was lying in a sleeping bag behind the shield wall, close to Dan, Tony, and the Captain, who were all in quiet discussion. He could make out what they were saying.&lt;br />\u201cYou\u2019ve been with Umbrella a while, Cap\u2019n. Could you give us some information about it? I\u2019d like to know what we\u2019re going up against here.\u201d Dan was saying.&lt;br />The Cap\u2019n leaned forward.&lt;br />\u201cJust how much do yer lads know?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cOther than that they\u2019re crazy as hell, a danger to one and all, and led by a crazy old man, nothing.\u201d Tony answered.&lt;br />Their giant cyborg companion rubbed a metal hand across his brow.&lt;br />\u201cWell, then in that case, I figger it\u2019s best if I begin at the beginnin\u2019.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWhat\u2019s the beginning?\u201d Dan asked quickly.&lt;br />\u201c1835. That was the year that the Umbrella Corporation was founded.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThat really is the beginning.\u201d Dan muttered.&lt;br />\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Richard staggered out of his sleeping bag. \u201cThe first Corporation was The Dutch East Indies Company, founded in 1867.\u201d&lt;br />The group looked up.&lt;br />\u201cAh,\u201d the Cap\u2019n said, \u201cBut that\u2019s where yer wrong.\u201d He smiled and carried on. \u201cI\u2019ll explain the whole thing, but first, lemme switch off me pirate voice modulator, so\u2019s yer three can unnerstand what I be tellin\u2019 yer.\u201d The Cap\u2019n entered a code series of numbers into a small keypad located on his wrist, and carried on in normal diction.&lt;br />\u201cThe Umbrella Corporation was founded in Europe, in 1835, by a man named Dr. Thaddeus Trans, an infamous scientist who was, up until 1820, a teacher at Oxford. That year he left under a flurry of scandal. He had reportedly raped and killed several of his students in order to perform a series of almost ritualistic experiments. After being banned from the university, and shunned by all the prominent social circles in London, he retreated to a private island off the coast of Norway.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWhat was Trans a doctor of?\u201d Dan asked.&lt;br />\u201cAt Oxford, he was a professor of bio-chemistry, but he also had degrees in psychology and anthropology.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cImpressive,\u201d remarked Tony.&lt;br />\u201cDuring his self-imposed exile, he presumably continued the horrific experiments he had begun at Oxford. For fifteen years he remained on the island, conducting his biological research. Then, in 1835, he returned to Europe and founded the world\u2019s first corporate entity, the Umbrella Corporation.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWhat did they sell?\u201d asked Richard.&lt;br />\u201cUmbrellas,\u201d answered the Cap\u2019n. \u201cOf course, the ones they sold were mostly all flammable, or insanely dangerous in some other way. Some of them actually ate people. Now, I don\u2019t know how they managed to do this, but they did. And I don\u2019t know how it happened, but the corporation thrived. For some unfathomable reason they became a leading power during the Industrial Revolution. They began to diversify. They branched off into textiles and machinery manufacturing. They also started to make weapons. The Umbrella Corporation was one of the primary suppliers of arms to both sides during both World Wars. By 1950, there was an Umbrella Corporation headquarters on every continent, in almost every country on the globe. Its success was incomprehensible. It was around this time, specifically 1952, when Ninja Pirate Incorporated was founded,\u201d he smiled, \u201cand I was built.\u201d&lt;br />The Cap\u2019n paused and stared thoughtfully off into space for a moment.&lt;br />\u201cSomehow they were at the exactly right point for both the Atomic Age boom and the Information Age boom, and now own several of the world\u2019s leading software companies. Close to twenty years ago, they began experimenting with reviving dead tissue. Ten years ago, industrial espionage resulted in disaster at their laboratories beneath Raccoon City. Five years after that, Raccoon City became flooded with the walking dead. And one year ago, you brave lads decided to try to take on the Umbrella Corporation. Next to a few impossibly beautiful super spies, you boys are the only enemies the Umbrella has had over their one hundred and seventy year history who have stayed alive long enough to cause them any serious trouble.\u201d&lt;br />Tony smiled appreciatively and thanked the Cap\u2019n. The giant creature nodded and continued.&lt;br />\u201cI have long guessed that the success of the corporation is in some way tied to the experiments Trans began at Oxford and finished on his island, all those years ago. Unfortunately, no one has any knowledge of the experiments save Trans himself.\u201d&lt;br />Dan interrupted, \u201cYou mean no one had any knowledge, right? Trans died decades ago, I assume.\u201d&lt;br />The Cap\u2019n looked grimly at Dan. \u201cNo, I used the proper tense. Dr. Thaddeus Trans, the maniac who founded the Umbrella Corporation one hundred and seventy years ago, is the same man who built me, fifty-five years ago, and is the same man whom Richard saw, one night ago.\u201dThere was a moment of stunned silence.&lt;br />\u201cBut that would mean he\u2019d have to be at least two hundred years old!\u201d exclaimed Dan.&lt;br />\u201cNo one knows how old Trans actually is,\u201d said the Cap\u2019n, \u201cexcept for Trans himself, of course.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThis is unbelievable. This means we are dealing with a very dangerous force.\u201d Tony said. \u201cRich, what more can you tell us about what you saw last night?\u201d&lt;br />There was no answer.&lt;br />\u201cRich?\u201d&lt;br />The three heroes looked over to Richard\u2019s sleeping bag.&lt;br />It was empty.&lt;br />&lt;br />Silas had managed to limp all the way from the engine room, around the field of battle, and into the processing plant near the gates. The processing plant, into which led the conveyor belts for the entire scrap metal yard, was unimaginably massive. It stretched into dusty obscurity as far as the eye could see. All the conveyor belts, three across the ceiling and one on either side of the doorway, ran to the back wall of the place, directly into a gargantuan blast furnace. The furnace was lit, and a raging fire inside. The opening to the furnace was thirty feet wide by twenty feet tall. MORE&lt;br />&lt;br />The shades of evening were beginning to fall, giving the scrap yard an otherworldly look. The last rays of the setting sun reached desperately around the frames of the mountains of ruined metal and massive machinery, silhouetting them against the dark sky. Richard ran panting to the entrance of the processing plant. He looked in and saw Blake.&lt;br />\u201cSilas, stop!\u201d yelled Richard from the doorway, his voice echoing through the clanking, cavernous factory.&lt;br />At the top landing of the staircase, Silas halted, sighed, and turned around. He looked down at his incorrigible foe with understanding, and a little impatience, but not surprise.&lt;br />\u201cWhen will you give up this foolishness, hero?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ve won. The world is mine, and you can\u2019t stop me.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cLeave that for me to decide.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou just can\u2019t quit, can you?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cLook, Silas, there are only five things I\u2019ve ever quit in my life: Gymnastics, theatre class, the Air Force, Sr. Marlene\u2019s English class, and orgies. The last of which I was rather good at. I will not quit when my friends\u2019 lives are threatened. I will not quit when a villain is about to escape. I cannot quit when the fate of the world is at stake.\u201d&lt;br />At this Silas gave a hollow, mirthless laugh.&lt;br />\u201cWhat world? A world populated by ignorant, inconsiderate morons? A world in which wealthy countries waste enough food each day to feed the entire population? A world in which wars are fought over a fuel source which pollutes and ruins? A world in which rivers, lakes, and streams are contaminated? Where forests are decimated to make cardboard? Where species go extinct and criminals thrive? A world in which all the best shows on FOX are cancelled before their prime, or left to rot like The Simpsons? A world in which you will never amount to your full potential because of the restrictions of society? A world in which you will seemingly never know a woman\u2019s love?\u201d&lt;br />Richard was speechless.&lt;br />\u201cAs I\u2019ve said before,\u201d Silas went on, \u201cI know you. You want this plague as much as I do. Let me go do my work and the earth will be returned to its natural, pure state. It will be a world where you have a chance to excel on your own terms. How about it? Let me go.\u201d&lt;br />For several long moments, Richard said nothing.&lt;br />He thought about political corruption, about deforestation, overpopulation, and pollution. He thought about ignorance, intolerance, and greed.&lt;br />Then he thought about his friends and family. He thought about their friends, and their families. He thought about everyone from his 96-year-old aunt to his 2-year-old cousin. He pictured Tony and Brendan and Dan. EJ and Andrew and Steve. He thought of Sam. With a rueful smile he thought of Pawel. He thought of Caitlin.&lt;br />Still, he said nothing.&lt;br />He then thought of Silas and the Umbrella Corporation. He thought about what a world run by them would be like.&lt;br />\u201cNo,\u201d he said flatly. He raised his laser rifle.&lt;br />Silas gaped.&lt;br />\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018no\u2019? You hate this world!\u201d&lt;br />Richard smiled.&lt;br />\u201cI do. But I love it as well. And there are other ways to change than destroying it.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou pansy!\u201d Silas yelled. \u201cI knew you didn\u2019t have the guts! All talk until your friends and family are threatened.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNo,\u201d said Richard again. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this for them. To be honest, they\u2019re expendable. To restore the earth to her pristine state, to end hate, greed, and ignorance, to wipe out two thirds of the population, I would gladly sacrifice myself and every one of them. Every friend. My entire family. It\u2019d be worth the loss.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThen why?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cBecause you won\u2019t end hate, greed, and intolerance. You\u2019ll proliferate them. You\u2019re not offering a more perfect world. You\u2019re offering your world.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell what about varying perspective? Who\u2019s to say they\u2019re not the same thing?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cMe.\u201d&lt;br />Richard fired his laser rifle. The shot took Silas in the thigh. His leg went numb and he collapsed onto the landing.&lt;br />\u201cYou stupid bastard!\u201d he screeched, holding his tingling thigh.&lt;br />\u201cSorry, Silas.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Silas said. \u201cBut you will be.\u201d&lt;br />He produced a small remote control device and entered a code into the keypad. Out of a dark side room came the two missing deathbots on their rumbling, spiked treads.&lt;br />Richard turned to fire at them, got off one shot, and then had to dive behind a gigantic iron bucket.&lt;br />Silas hobbled up the metal steps and disappeared through the rooftop access door.&lt;br />The two deathbots closed in, firing their lasers relentlessly at iron shield, slowly chipping it away.&lt;br />Just as Richard thought he was finished (for what was probably the fifth time in as many hours) he heard a familiar horn, saw two glaring headlights, and gazed in disbelief as a midnight blue streak tore into the vast room, missiles blasting, and shot the tracks out from under the one of the deathbots. The other turned too slowly to stop this lightning bolt of dark azure from colliding into it and knocking it across the room onto its side.&lt;br />As that deathbot struggled to right itself, the mysterious machine that had come to Richard\u2019s rescue pulled to a stop beside him and idled quietly.&lt;br />Richard reached out and touched the powerful automobile, and breathlessly uttered one word:&lt;br />\u201cPachuco.\u201d&lt;br />Indeed. The vehicle before him was none other than his beloved \u201ctough guy,\u201d long missing and presumed totaled.&lt;br />He rubbed his fingers gently over the dented, rusting chassis which still gleamed a dull, deep blue.&lt;br />\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, boy,\u201d said Richard, choking back tears.&lt;br />The car revved quietly to say that the feeling was mutual.&lt;br />\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d Richard asked. \u201cHow did you end up here?\u201d&lt;br />Through a series of honks and revs, Pachuco related the tale of how the diabolical Umbrella Corporation had sabotaged his motor belt, leaving Richard with no choice but to donate the majestic vehicle for spare parts. Unbeknownst to Richard, however, the Umbrella Corporation owned the auto yard to which Pachuco was sent. For months, Dr. Thaddeus Trans had overseen the torture of the great Pachuco in an attempt to gain more information on the heroes\u2019 plans and movements. The brave Oldsmobile had revealed nothing.&lt;br />Then, when Silas came into power, and Trans was reduced to a mere shell, Pachuco had been sent to the scrap metal processing plant. Silas had no more interest in the car and scheduled it for destruction.&lt;br />Pachuco had been chained to a wall in a back room, but the force of the gates being blown apart had loosened the mortar, and after an hour of pulling he had come loose.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Chuke,\u201d Richard said, patting the car.&lt;br />Pachuco idled a gentle \u201cI forgive you.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter now boy, we\u2019re together.\u201d&lt;br />Suddenly the trackless deathbot fired a missile into the car\u2019s flank, blasting off the rear left door. Pachuco rocked on his tires, settled, then spun around and fired a missile at the deathbot, blowing it to pieces.&lt;br />The second robot had righted itself, and fired its twin laser canons. The shots missed, deflected off of the iron bucket. Richard grabbed his laser rifle and looked through the scope at the mechanical menace.&lt;br />The deathbot was continuing to fire, but a panel opened and a digital clock appeared. It was slowly counting down from two minutes.&lt;br />\u201cChuke!\u201d yelled Rich, \u201cIt\u2019s activated an explosive device. The thing\u2019s gonna blow in two!\u201d&lt;br />The car revved concernedly then tore out from behind the shield and charged the deathbot. The machine\u2019s laser canons glanced off of Pachuco\u2019s glittering blue chassis and the vehicle kept going. The deathbot fired missiles now. One missed, but the other hit Pachuco\u2019s windshield, ripping the roof off the car and shattering the glass. The now-convertible Pachuco still drove onward, finally reaching the robot, which lashed out with its pincer arms just in time to stop the car from crashing into it. The deathbot engaged its tracks and an astounding pushing match began.&lt;br />The spiked tracks of the deathbot and the tires of Pachuco ground into the muddy cement floor of the factory. The pulse back and forth was even for a time. One would gain ground, the other loose, and then the reverse. Pachuco spun his tires and the hulking metallic combatants slowly began to turn. Eventually the deathbot, its pincers now digging into Pachuco\u2019s hood and bumper, had its back to the blast furnace.&lt;br />Sensing the danger it was in, the monstrous robot redoubled its efforts and Pachuco began to slide backward.&lt;br />\u201cChuke! What are you doing?!\u201d Rich yelled.&lt;br />Hearing his friend\u2019s voice, the car pushed back, all six cylinders of it\u2019s mighty engine blasting. The deathbot was forced backward toward the gaping fiery maw of the blast furnace. With unrelenting force, Pachuco strove forward.&lt;br />The deathbot fired all its laser weapons, but even at such close range, its attempts were in vain. Pachuco surged forward.&lt;br />Richard ran to his beloved vehicle, laser rifle at the ready, and blasted at the deathbot. Taking careful aim, he shot at a weak point, a section of exposed neck where the heavy armor had fallen loose.&lt;br />The evil machine\u2019s bulky head flew off in a shower of sparks and flame and landed with a bang near Richard. Its single glowing eye went dim.&lt;br />Pachuco continued to push, however, straight toward the blast furnace. Richard ran to his car\u2019s side.&lt;br />\u201cChukester . . . buddy . . .. What are you doing?\u201d&lt;br />The car revved loudly.&lt;br />\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re stuck?\u201d&lt;br />The car revved again and Richard looked to the hood and bumper where the deathbot\u2019s talon-like pincers were still locked.&lt;br />He ran to the front of the cart and tried to wrench the claws loose, but to no avail. He shot desperately at the thick, metal arms of the mechanical beast, but his blasts ricocheted off.&lt;br />\u201cNo!\u201d he cried.&lt;br />He looked at the countdown clock on the robot\u2019s chest. Forty-five seconds left.&lt;br />\u201cPachuco, there has to be another way! Listen to me!\u201d&lt;br />The car revved.&lt;br />\u201cNo! I won\u2019t leave you! I love you, Chuke!\u201d&lt;br />The car\u2019s engine gurgled softly, reciprocating the sentiment.&lt;br />Richard stayed where he was, trotting alongside the vehicle as it pushed inexorably toward fiery doom.&lt;br />Pachuco revved another command to Richard. \u201cLeave now!\u201d&lt;br />With a last surge of strength, Pachuco pushed himself and the decapitated deathbot into the flames. The car honked a last order and the massive furnace doors began to close.&lt;br />Richard took a final look at his friend and ran to the doorway. He made it out of the factory, pulled the switch controlling the entrance, and the heavy metal doors slid closed just in time.&lt;br />The blast raged briefly inside the processing plant, and the doors creaked on their hinges, but held. When the explosion had subsided, the old brick building sagged slightly.&lt;br />Richard\u2019 eyes filled with tears. He sunk to his knees on the muddy ground and sobbed gently, alone.&lt;br />&lt;br />The heroes\u2019 camp was buzzing with activity as Richard stumbled back some time later. Caitlin was conversing with the Cap\u2019n as the NP Inc agents descended from helicopters hovering over the battlefield. With startling efficiency, they bound the Umbrella Corp soldiers in energy shackles and loaded them onto the gun ships for transport to the Ninja Pirate holding cells. Elsewhere in the area, wounds were being mended, vehicles repaired, weapons collected. Dan and Tony, who had been anxiously looking for Richard since the Cap\u2019n\u2019s narrative had concluded, spotted him and rushed over.&lt;br />Richard\u2019s shoulders were low, his eyes were red rimmed, but now tearless. He looked dazed.&lt;br />\u201cRich, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dan asked.&lt;br />\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Tony, \u201cyou don\u2019t look so good. Mind you, I\u2019m not even talking about all the cuts, bruises, burns, and the gallons of mud which are covering your exterior. You look devastated.\u201d&lt;br />Richard looked at his two friends as if he didn\u2019t know them.&lt;br />\u201cPachuco,\u201d he said.&lt;br />\u201cYour old car?\u201d Dan asked.&lt;br />\u201cWhat about ol\u2019 Chuke?\u201d inquired Tony.&lt;br />\u201cDead.\u201d Richard said tonelessly. \u201cGone. Gave his life for me. I tried to stop him. Wouldn\u2019t listen. Why wouldn\u2019t he listen?\u201d&lt;br />Tony and Dan exchanged puzzled looks.&lt;br />\u201cCare to give the full story, amigo?\u201d&lt;br />Richard did not elaborate, however, but brushed wordlessly past his confused friends and made his way towards the circle of cars. He had covered half the distance when he bumped rudely in Steph, who was carrying an armful of UC laser rifles to Pat Dandrea\u2019s van.&lt;br />\u201cJeez, Rich,\u201d she said as the weapons tumbled out of her hand, \u201cI didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d&lt;br />She looked more closely at him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d&lt;br />Richard turned a vacant gaze her way, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he listen to me? Had to be another way . . ..\u201d&lt;br />Steph did not stand in indecision like Tony and Dan had. She knew what to do. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, she slapped him across the face as hard as she could. Richard staggered backward. His legs gave out and he collapsed to the ground. He sat in the mud, rubbing his flaring cheek and bleeding lip, staring up at Steph with fire in his eyes.&lt;br />The sophomore stood over him and peered down at him with a confusing mix of contempt and concern. One hand was on her hip; the other was still poking out of the sling.&lt;br />\u201cListen, Rich. I understand you\u2019re upset over something. I want to talk with you and help you through it, but at the proper time and place. Now, you need to pull yourself together!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Richard yelled. \u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019ve been through today. I just lost a friend!\u201d&lt;br />Steph was silent for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quietly. Then she got through to Richard. \u201cYou lost your friend. What would that friend say to you now? What if that your friend saw you like this, wallowing in grief. We need you, Rich. You\u2019re a cornerstone to this operation. Things will fall apart without you, damnit! Now we\u2019ve won this battle, but we\u2019re not done yet!\u201d She reached out her good hand and pulled him up.&lt;br />Richard smiled. \u201cThanks, Steph. I needed that. And you\u2019re right; we\u2019re not done yet. Not by a long shot.\u201d He stooped to help Steph gather the rifles and then started off toward Caitlin and the Cap\u2019n. The he turned back to Steph.&lt;br />\u201cHey, could I have one more?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNo, you pervert! Now get to work!\u201d She took off to Dandrea\u2019s van.&lt;br />&lt;br />Richard approaches Steve: many injured, Mike wakes up, \u201cAntie Em\u201d routine, Brendan and Will and Justin volunteer to drive wounded to hospital.&lt;br />&lt;br />Richard walked up to the Cap\u2019n.&lt;br />\u201cHey Cap. Hello Cait. You guys handled that well.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThanks, Rich,\u201d said Caitlin.&lt;br />\u201cCap\u2019n,\u201d Rich said, \u201cCould you spare a helicopter?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell, mate, we\u2019re a bit short of soldiers . . ..\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI don\u2019t need soldiers. I just want a copter on autopilot. Dan ain\u2019t the only one who can plan.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />Richard then made his way directly back to Tony and Dan, who were talking excitedly about the possibilities open to them Ninja Pirate Inc. Richard wasted no time with explanations, but began to speak immediately.&lt;br />\u201cI figure, if we send an auto-piloted helicopter to distract the main guns, and that allows us to break through the gates and engage the enemy troops in yet another distraction. That way, a small group of us can---\u201d&lt;br />\u201cHo ho ho ho!\u201d interrupted Dan. \u201cHold on a minute. What are you talking about?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cOur attack plans for the UC headquarters off the canal, of course.\u201d&lt;br />His friends were silent.&lt;br />\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Tony. \u201cWe set out to stop Silas and we did just that. In addition, we acquired NP Inc. If we continued the mission we\u2019d be with a much smaller force, as well. There are many wounded and my father and his friends had to leave. They had other business to take care of. So why bother attacking Umbrella now?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cBecause we haven\u2019t accomplished our goal, yet. Silas is still out there.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSo what? Someone has to be CEO of Umbrella. We can\u2019t take on the entire corporation at once, you know.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cTrue, someone has to lead Umbrella. But Silas is far too dangerous to be that someone. In the past three or four of us have stopped whole armies and two assassination attempts with little fuss when Trans and the Cap\u2019n ran UC. This time we came in full force and barely won the battle. Moreover, Silas beat us all, even when we were together. I\u2019m certain that if he is allowed to guide the Umbrella Corporation, our days are numbered. We can beat a Trans Umbrella Corporation, but a Blake Umbrella Corporation will finish us with ease before turning its sights on the whole world.\u201d&lt;br />Tony and Dan absorbed what Richard had said.&lt;br />\u201cRichard\u2019s right,\u201d said Tony thoughtfully. \u201cBlake is too dangerous to us, and the world at large. Plus, he\u2019s now hell-bent on revenge, I imagine. And, we never actually stopped his plan. The Commons are still scheduled for destruction, and the viruses are set to go out.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cGoddamnit!\u201d yelled Dan. \u201cAm I never going to get back to those girls? You said you wanted me for one night. What the hell am I doing here?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou\u2019ve enjoyed the adventure,\u201d Tony said.&lt;br />\u201cAnd,\u201d Rich added, \u201cwhy stop now. We haven\u2019t used your plan yet. By the way, I\u2019ve come up with a few additions . . ..\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />The two guards stationed at the Umbrella Corp\u2019s gates were tired. Because of the massive drain on the headquarters\u2019 troops caused by Silas\u2019 bold offensive plan, they were on the tail end of a double shift.&lt;br />Suddenly, they were jerked to wakefulness by a low rumble.&lt;br />They peered through the thick darkness down the length of the road, but could see nothing. Then, a large shape began to emerge. Plowing slowly but unstoppably came the bulldozer from the scrap yard, with Steph at the controls again. The guards first tried to stop the machine by opening fire with their laser rifles, but the beams glanced off of the huge blade and the yellow juggernaut did not even slow. The stood shooting until the machine was almost on top of them. They had barely enough time to leap out the way, straight into the oily canal, before the bulldozer crashed into the iron gates, bending and twisting the solid metal, and tearing them off at the hinges. Steph did not stop at the gates, however, but plowed down the length of the bridge to the main factory building. Behind her three cars pulled through the ruined remains of the iron blockade and made their way to the narrow cobblestone street which ran in front of the old complex along the length of the canal. Out leapt a third of the heroes\u2019 force. Just as they had exited the cars and readied the weapons, a battalion of Umbrella guards with laser rifles pored out of the massive front doors, firing. The Cap\u2019n and Andrew, who had been in the lead car, were in charge of this portion of the troops, and quickly formed them into lines to face the oncoming threat. A hail of laser beams rained down upon both sides as the battle began.&lt;br />&lt;br />Meanwhile, down the road a distance, near a small railroad station, a group of students were climbing aboard a creaking old railroad car. Dan stood at the controls in the engine car. After about a half an hour\u2019s worth of frustrated tinkering, he and Adam Goddu had managed to get the old locomotive running. Aligning the tracks, they had set the sluggish metal worm on a collision course with the back of the factory. Sam had gone ahead and driven a UC SUV along the train tracks and parked it over them as close to the main building as he could. There he waited for his friends to arrive and begin the second phase of the attack.&lt;br />Dan started train moving, very slowly at first, but building in speed, and they were soon pushing along at a reasonable pace on the old, rusting tracks which ran behind all the factories of the district. At the back of the engine car, Pat Dandrea and Jason Frank were furiously shoveling coal into a furnace to maintain the ancient train\u2019s speed.&lt;br />In the rickety boxcar directly behind the train, the other remaining third of the force gripped their weapons tensely.&lt;br />\u201cI hope this plan works,\u201d said Meg, huddling close to Brendan.&lt;br />\u201cI know it will. It\u2019s one of Dan\u2019s. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s well on top of things.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />Back in the engine room, Dan was worried. He had no idea what condition the tracks were in, or if the train would derail properly. In addition, for the plan to work, his force would have to jump out of the moving locomotive, a dangerous maneuver. He steeled himself up for the demanding task before him, gripped the controls firmly, and peered ahead at the velvety black sky.&lt;br />&lt;br />In a small, sleek black helicopter high above the battle, Silas sat watching the action unfold.&lt;br />\u201cMagnificent,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThose fools are going to destroy the base and kill Trans. They\u2019ll do my dirty work for me. When the smoke clears, I\u2019ll be the unquestioned head of the Umbrella Corporation.\u201d&lt;br />The pilot to the left of him spoke. \u201cDid you say something, sir?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNo, nothing of consequence. Take me to Base Central.\u201d&lt;br />The pilot guided the aircraft in a gradual bank and flew north.&lt;br />&lt;br />Corporate lawyer Mr. Hazzard watched the battle from a third-story office. He gazed grimly through the expansive, soiled glass of the room\u2019s one, wall-sized window.&lt;br />\u201cThis is in blatant violation of numerous trespassing and personal property destruction statutes. Such disregard for the law . . ..\u201d&lt;br />He looked into the sky at the sound of helicopter propellers churning the air. To his right, a small black craft was flying away to toward South Hadley. He looked straight ahead and his jaw dropped as he beheld a much larger, more powerful looking white copter flying towards the roof in apparent attempt to unload troops. The vehicle bore the Ninja Pirate logo.&lt;br />\u201cMust be the leaders of this rabble,\u201d Hazzard thought. \u201cLeaving their soldiers to fight as a distraction while trying to secretly sneak into the complex from the roof. Not this time.\u201d&lt;br />Hazzard rushed to his desk and hit an intercom button.&lt;br />\u201cThis is Hazzard,\u201d he said urgently. \u201cTrain forward roof cannons on approaching air craft. Shoot that thing out of the sky!\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />On the flat top of the main building, two large guns turned noiselessly and targeted the Ninja Pirate helicopter. The twin ion cannons fired in unison, both shots hitting the oncoming helicopter dead center. The vehicle burst into a ball of flames, hung in the sky for a moment, and then plummeted to earth, crashing into the road on the opposite side of the canal, a pile of twisted, flaming wreckage.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cWell that threat\u2019s out of the way. Those soldiers should be easily broken without their leaders.\u201d Hazzard smiled in grim satisfaction.&lt;br />&lt;br />There was a momentary lull in the battle as both sides turned to see the helicopter explode in the sky above them. The whole scene, which had been lit only by the dim halogen lights of the complex, was illuminated as bright as day with the aircraft\u2019s ruin. As the copter fell, the bright light faded and the battle resumed.&lt;br />&lt;br />Andrew had taken half of the small force of heroes and tried to stem the tide of Umbrella Corporation troops still filing out of the main building. Their concentrated heavy fire was paying off, and the amount of unconscious soldiers piling up in the doorway controlled the enemies\u2019 reinforcements. Andrew was shooting side by side with Pawel and Marissa. Behind that trio were EJ and Dave. EJ had managed to find a supply of blunt object-pipes, automobile parts, bricks-anything he could get his hands on, and was hurling them at the frustrated enemy soldiers while shouting, \u201cI\u2019ll trade a whuppin\u2019 for some sores. Whuppin\u2019 for sores!\u201d Dave, running low on his Molotov cocktail supply, was nonetheless battling bravely onward next to his friend. Steph and Becky, standing nearby, gave the pair odd looks while knocking out dozens of UC troops.&lt;br />Meanwhile, the Cap\u2019n had taken the other half of the group and was trying to combat the enemies already out of the building and advancing rapidly. The giant robot fired undaunted into the ranks of soldiers, while by his side were Jenn and Will Murray. Also taking cover around the halted bulldozer were Caitlin, Sarah Cantler, and Tara Maroney.&lt;br />The heroes fought on bravely, but the Umbrella troops were dangerously close to overpowering them.&lt;br />&lt;br />Elsewhere, four other heroes were making their way across the canal in a small rubber raft. Amy, Tony, Steve, and Richard also stared at the flaming helicopter as it crashed.&lt;br />\u201cDamn,\u201d said Rich, \u201cI know we now have the element of surprise, but that wreck is gonna mean roadwork for weeks. So much for my shortcut.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cFocus on the mission, Rich,\u201d Amy reminded him.&lt;br />He nodded and looked ahead as they entered the forbidding drainage pipe on the factory-side of the canal.&lt;br />The pipe was more of a tunnel, large enough for a man to stand up in. It was pitch black.&lt;br />\u201cAnyone got a flashlight?\u201d Tony asked.&lt;br />\u201cSure, right here in my backpack,\u201d said Rich, and proceeded to pull out the largest flashlight any of the other three had ever seen. It was silver and black, and the glass piece covering the bulb was the size of a dinner plate. Richard positioned the flashlight at the bow of the raft and turned it on.&lt;br />The tunnel was flooded with blinding white light. The effect on the eyes was a small degree less severe than that after a nuclear bomb. The four friends tumbled sightlessly around the small raft, waiting for their eyes to adjust.&lt;br />When at last they could see again, Tony, Amy, and Steve looked fearfully at their surroundings. Richard was still faking blindness and reaching out with groping hands at the other three members of the unit. His fingers touched on one of Amy\u2019s supple breasts and he received a slap to the face.&lt;br />\u201cCut it out, Rich, this is serious,\u201d she said.&lt;br />\u201cTwo slaps in one day,\u201d Richard mused. \u201cNot bad . . ..\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI swear, when we are all given positions at NP Inc, I\u2019m making you vice president in charge of groping,\u201d Tony said wryly.&lt;br />\u201cWho\u2019s president?\u201d Richard asked, offended that he did not get the top spot.&lt;br />\u201cMe,\u201d answered Amy, who quickly felt up her three companions with a devious smile playing about her lips.&lt;br />\u201cPeople! People! Please!\u201d Steve said, uncharacteristically the levelheaded one. \u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of time for risqu\u00e9 behavior later on. Right now we need to find our way into this Godforsaken place.\u201d&lt;br />The heroes turned their attention back to the unfortunately brightly lit tunnel.&lt;br />The pipe of corrugated metal in which they were traveling ran from some as yet unknown place in the main factory building to the outlet in the canal through which the heroes had entered. Oily canal water lapped at the sides of the tunnel, and there were visible stains from rust and that foul water along the pipe. Sickly green plants of some indistinguishable aquatic variety trailed down from the curved ceiling in wet strips. Dark shapes moved eerily though the water on either side of the boat. Eels of some sort, no doubt. Most were small, a yard long or so, but Richard caught sight of a few that had the girth of the coffee can and seemed to be longer than the Falcon. He tried not to look into the water too much. Instead, he looked ahead of him, toward the end of the tunnel. Bright though his flashlight was, Richard could still see no definite end of the pipe, merely blackness far in the distance.&lt;br />Grimly, he and his friends paddled their raft though the frightening tunnel.&lt;br />&lt;br />Back at the frontlines, the heroes\u2019 divided force were not faring well against the Umbrella Corporation troops. They had been effectively pinned behind the three cars and the massive blade of the bulldozer, and the UC soldiers were still advancing.&lt;br />Jake looked upon the ranks of enemies with a strange gleam in his eyes. He unzipped his jacket to reveal a vest made of plastic explosive. Pulling the detonator out of his pocket, he began to scramble forward over the cars toward the UC goons. Cap\u2019n Huzuki-bot 3500 reached forward and pulled him back to safety.&lt;br />\u201cDamnit, you stupid robot! Let me go! I want to commit suicide and take as many of those bastards out as I can!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cEasy, son,\u201d said the Cap\u2019n soothingly. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to kill, so no luck on them fancy bombsa yers. Moreover, me good mate, you\u2019re a pirate, not a ninja. Pirates don\u2019t much go in fer suicide. We prefer to fight an\u2019 run away.\u201d&lt;br />Jake looked thoughtful.&lt;br />\u201cOh, all right!\u201d he conceded, and whipped out two laser pistols.&lt;br />Despite his, and others\u2019, bravado, the enemy drew closer still.&lt;br />&lt;br />Speeding along the train tracks came the ancient locomotive. Dan at the controls anxiously looked ahead toward the parked SUV. When he judged the time to be right, he spoke to Pat and Jason over his shoulder.&lt;br />\u201cIt\u2019s time, guys. That\u2019ll be enough coal, you can go and tell the others that it\u2019s time to disconnect the cars.\u201d&lt;br />Jason and Pat gratefully dropped the shovels and moved into the other car.&lt;br />\u201cWe\u2019re going to disconnect now, everybody,\u201d said Pat.&lt;br />\u201cDan says that when the car slows enough, we\u2019re to leap off in pairs and make our way to the front of the building along the left side.\u201d Jason explained.&lt;br />\u201cAs the right side will be slowly crumbling and demolished, if all goes to plan.\u201d Pat finished.&lt;br />The two boys moved back to the space between the cars. The wind rushed past them, flattening their hair against their heads. They had to shout to each other to be heard.&lt;br />\u201cLet\u2019s try it together!\u201d yelled Pat.&lt;br />Jason nodded, and they both gripped the pin firmly. They yanked upwards with a mighty heave, but the pin refused to budge.&lt;br />\u201cThis is no good!\u201d Jason hollered over the screaming wind. \u201cWe need help!\u201d&lt;br />As if on cue, Sam and Adam appeared behind them.&lt;br />The four boys grabbed onto the iron rod and began to pull.&lt;br />The pin slowly rose up out of its slot with a grating scratch of rusted iron on iron that was audible despite the noise of the train and the howl of the rushing air.&lt;br />Finally, as the four friends were about strained to the limit, the pin popped free and they all fell back against the boxcar door in a heap. They lay there breathing heavily.&lt;br />Suddenly, just as the car was beginning to separate, Sam leapt across the gap and landed on the still speeding engine.&lt;br />\u201cDamnit, Sam!\u201d yelled Adam, afraid for his chum, \u201c what the hell are you doing?!\u201d&lt;br />Sam smiled back at the three gaping boys, his jet-black hair leaping around his flushed face in the raging current of the wind.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019m gonna ride this baby to Valhalla!\u201d he bellowed, and disappeared into the front car.&lt;br />&lt;br />Dan whirled around as Sam entered.&lt;br />\u201cSam, what the hell are you doing?!\u201d he asked frantically.&lt;br />\u201cEverybody says that,\u201d Sam muttered.&lt;br />\u201cThis train is going to collide with the back of the factory. Do you realize how dangerous this is?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI know what I\u2019m doing, Dan,\u201d Sam said calmly. \u201cI thought you might like some company.\u201d&lt;br />Dan smiled and turned his attention back to the tracks.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the boxcar, Jason and Pat were helping their fellow crusaders off the train. They had slid open the huge side door and were letting the heroes off in pairs.&lt;br />Brendan and Meg jumped first. They collapsed to their knees to soften the blow, rolled once, and stood up. Adam, with a grinning Ashley Lapointe, had to be forced off. It had taken every ounce of strength Pat and Jason had to stop him from trying to make the leap to the engine car himself to save his friend. Next came Mike Pytka, looking a little green, and Evelyn, gripping him fiercely. When they had made it safely, Sarah Sawka stood up and looked at the two boys.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019m scared. Will one of you jump with me?\u201d&lt;br />Jason stepped forward immediately.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d&lt;br />Holding Sarah tightly to him, he jumped out of the moving train, leaving Pat alone.&lt;br />Pat gave one last look around before slinging his laser rifle over his shoulder and leaping out himself.&lt;br />He hit the ground well, stumbled forward a little, then righted himself and trotted around the back of the building to the left to join up with his friends.&lt;br />&lt;br />Back in the engine, Dan and Sam were making some last minute calculations.&lt;br />\u201cEverything should be fine,\u201d Dan said worriedly, \u201cexcept for the leaping out of a speeding train part.\u201d&lt;br />Sam patted him on the back, smiled, and opened the rear door.&lt;br />The two boys stood on the small platform at the back of the engine car. They faced the rapidly receding tracks and glanced right. Glistening pavement. They glanced left. Rugged, grass land, softened by the rain and near to the river.&lt;br />\u201cLeft it is,\u201d muttered Dan. He and Sam took position.&lt;br />\u201cOn three?\u201d asked Sam.&lt;br />Dan looked ahead at the SUV, frighteningly close now, and nodded.&lt;br />The hulking black vehicle was only 20 feet away.&lt;br />\u201cOne . . .\u201d they said together.&lt;br />18 feet.&lt;br />\u201cTwo . . .\u201d&lt;br />16 feet.&lt;br />\u201cThree!\u201d&lt;br />When impact was less than 8 seconds away, they bent their knees, closed their eyes, and leapt out into the swirling air.&lt;br />The two friends hit the soft grassland with a thud and immediately collapsed; they rolled several times before coming to a stop and laying motionless on the cold, moist ground.&lt;br />&lt;br />The train plowed directly into the SUV, and through it. Twisted hunks of flaming metal spewed out to either side. Fire engulfed the unblinking eye of the train\u2019s headlight. Pieces of the destroyed black vehicle caught in the locomotive\u2019s rusted pistons and gears and caused the desired havoc.&lt;br />The mighty train was wrenched off of the tracks and went careening with an ungodly screech of tortured metal toward the rear of the main factory building. Still moving frighteningly fast, the engine collided into the brick wall and exploded in a startling ball of crimson flame. The train\u2019s final force shook the towering building to its foundations as the ruined hunk of steel tore into the corner of the crumbling brick factory. It pushed through the wall and into the building beyond, shattering windows and destroying a whole wing of the structure.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the front of the building, the startled UC troops, on the verge of victory, spun around despite the battle in front of them to gaze in horror at the devastation.&lt;br />The heroes were expecting the explosion, but not at this magnitude, and also found themselves enthralled by the destruction.&lt;br />Both sides were shocked back into action by the charge of the train\u2019s former occupants, the missing half of the heroes\u2019 army. They came yelling and blasting around the side of the building and caught the UC troops with another successful pincer formation.&lt;br />The force behind the cars climbed over their barricade and met the enemy in close combat, fighting with renewed fury.&lt;br />Umbrella\u2019s once impressive horde of deadly mercenaries was overpowered. They had lost the will to fight. Small pockets were already starting to surrender. The heroes were about to win.&lt;br />&lt;br />Suddenly the rooftop cannons opened fire again. The soldier who had been manning them were called into the battle, but Mr. Hazzard had made his way to the control room and was blasting at the armies in front of the building with abandon. An explosion to the right of the still fighting masses sent many reeling. The cannons repositioned themselves and were aimed at the center of the fray.&lt;br />&lt;br />Before they could fire, twin rockets shrieked through air up at them, reducing them both to ruined heaps.&lt;br />&lt;br />Dan and Sam had made it to the battle!&lt;br />&lt;br />Sam put down his rocket launcher and ran forward through the melee to the bulldozer. He pushed Steph lightly out of the way as he climbed behind the controls.&lt;br />\u201cSteph, go make me some pancakes and let me show you how to really use this thing!\u201d&lt;br />He put the hulking machine into gear and plowed forward. The heroes and Umbrella Corporation soldiers scattered out of the way as he rumbled past.&lt;br />\u201cThis should make sure no one uses any of the building\u2019s other defenses against us,\u201d he said to himself.&lt;br />The bulldozer drove straight into the factory\u2019s power plant, knocking over power lines and demolishing the squat brick structure which held the generators supplying power to the complex. Sam continued to destroy anything he could long after the energy was cut to the factory and the battle had resumed.&lt;br />&lt;br />The small expedition into the bowels of the complex had finally reached the end of their tunnel. Before them was a solid wall, brick and other stone, out of which emptied numerous pipes of varying sizes. A particularly large one was spewing out a thick grey substance, while two smaller pies to its left and right were gently trickling out streams of a dark blue liquid. Out of a fourth duct of medium size to the far right was pouring oily greenish brown ooze into the canal.&lt;br />To the heroes\u2019 collective left was a cement staircase that rose from the depths of the filthy water around them to a metal maintenance door. They tied the raft to the staircase\u2019s railing and clambered up to the door.&lt;br />Tony stepped forward and tried it. The door slid eerily open, revealing a steamy machine room. The four friends stepped inside.&lt;br />&lt;br />They made their way past the rows of hissing, clanking machinery to another door at the opposite side of the room. This one was also unlocked. They entered the corridor beyond. As Sam had cut the power, the only light was the dim, red illumination of the back-up source. They observed the hallway. It extended into the ruby darkness as far as they could see in both directions.&lt;br />\u201cTime to split up again, methinks,\u201d said Richard.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019ll go with Amy,\u201d Tony said.&lt;br />\u201cDamnit,\u201d said Rich.&lt;br />\u201cDamnit,\u201d said Steve.&lt;br />Amy smiled.&lt;br />\u201cC\u2019mon, Tones,\u201d she said. \u201cGood luck, guys.\u201d And the pair took off down the left path.&lt;br />Richard and Steve nodded to each other and started down the right.&lt;br />&lt;br />They hadn\u2019t been going far when they came to an elevator.&lt;br />\u201cThis is what we need,\u201d said Richard. \u201cOur target is undoubtedly on the higher floors.\u201d&lt;br />The stepped into the shining metal box and observed the buttons.&lt;br />\u201cAmazing . . .\u201d Rich said, in awe.&lt;br />There were four floors above ground, but below the floor they were on now, what Richard had thought to be the sub-basement, were twenty more levels.&lt;br />Steve leaned forward and pushed the button for the second floor.&lt;br />They waited the few seconds that it took to rise two floors, and as soon as the doors slid open again with a friendly ding, the stepped through.&lt;br />The second floor was in shambles. Lights hung, flickering and sparking, distended from the fixtures. Papers and broken glass littered the floor. In front of them in the hallway was an overturned desk. This was not the most disturbing part of the picture, however. The walls, floor, and ceiling were all smeared with blood.&lt;br />\u201cGood God . . .\u201d muttered Rich, looking around in horror.&lt;br />\u201cWhat the hell happened here?\u201d Steve asked no one in particular.&lt;br />The elevator doors closed behind them and the box moved up the shaft to some higher level.&lt;br />\u201cWhat could have done this?\u201d Richard asked.&lt;br />Suddenly, they heard a heavy galloping sound from the hallway ahead and to the right of them.&lt;br />\u201cI have a bad feeling we\u2019re about to find out,\u201d said Steve.&lt;br />&lt;br />The two friends stood shaking, their laser pistols ready, staring down the corridor ahead of them. The galloping, thumping sound grew louder. Richard could also discern a slight clicking sound intermingled with it. It reminded him of his dog walking across the linoleum.&lt;br />The sound grew deafening. Before either of them was ready, it appeared.&lt;br />Around the corner at the end of the hallway bounded a huge, dark shape with glowing yellow eyes.&lt;br />\u201cIs that a bear?\u201d asked Steve in disbelief.&lt;br />The monster howled.&lt;br />\u201cI th-think it\u2019s a . . . dog,\u201d Richard stammered.&lt;br />In a flash the beast was upon them. It moved astoundingly fast. Richard had barely gotten off one shot, which didn\u2019t seem to pierce the monster\u2019s thick hide, when it sunk its teeth into his arm.&lt;br />He screamed in pain. The beast swung its thick neck and hurled Richard across the room. He slammed against the wall and clutched his bleeding forearm. The beast snarled and closed in.&lt;br />Steve fired several shots from his laser pistol. They hit the beast\u2019s broad back and it whirled around with a roar to face him.&lt;br />Steve fired again, but the shots, even on the highest setting, had little effect. Steve backed up slowly, getting closer and closer to the elevator\u2019s doors.&lt;br />Richard staggered up, held his pistol with a trembling hand, and yelled to Steve.&lt;br />\u201cGet ready to pin yourself to the wall!\u201d&lt;br />Steve\u2019s head bobbed up and down in acknowledgement, but he couldn\u2019t tear his eyes from the advancing beast.&lt;br />Richard fired once, hit the elevator control panel, and the doors slid open, revealing an empty shaft. The shot startled the beast, and it began to run at Steve, opening and closing its slavering jaws.&lt;br />The monster leapt into the air, its claws pointed at Steve.&lt;br />\u201cNow!\u201d yelled Rich, and Steve threw himself against the wall just as the beast flew past him. It turned its head and bit Steve\u2019s shoulder before flying into the open shaft, crashing against the opposite side, and plummeting with a howl into the blackness below.&lt;br />Steve was pulled to the ground and lay there bleeding.&lt;br />Richard hobbled over shakily and help him up. He supported his friend as they continued down the hall.&lt;br />&lt;br />Amy and Tony had cautiously made their way to the end of the first corridor and turned left again. They continued onward, following whichever path lay open to them. Eventually the two friends came to an especially dark room. They felt their way along the wall, squinting their eyes in a vain attempt to see. Tony, in the lead, felt his hand come into contact with a switch of some sort.&lt;br />\u201cI got the lights, Ames,\u201d Tony said, and flipped the switch.&lt;br />No lights came on, but they heard a strange metallic click issue from the walls around them. It was loud. The sound magnified, it seemed, as though it was not a single click, but rather a chorus of small ones.&lt;br />\u201cUh, Tony, what was that?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNot sure. I think I have another switch here.\u201d&lt;br />He flipped the second one. This time the lights came on, and they were able to see what had made the clicking noises.&lt;br />They were in a large laboratory room. Lining the walls was cages upon cages, stacked five high. They were simple, shining metal cages, like those at a pet store. The creatures within them were nowhere near as wholesome as puppies, however.&lt;br />With a maddening, leathery rustle, the things took flight and swarmed, screeching, around the two friends.&lt;br />\u201cBats!\u201d Amy screamed.&lt;br />For, indeed, they had unwittingly awoken a multitude of the flying mammals. These were especially large bats, however, and angry too. They enveloped Tony and Amy in fluttering, chirping clouds. Swatting seemed to do no good, there were far too many of the beasts. Tony was the first to be bitten. He didn\u2019t feel it for a moment, and was instead alerted by the blood dripping down his neck. Then the wound began to burn. The smell of blood drove the bats into an even more maddened frenzy, and both he and Amy were soon covered in inflamed bites and scratches. Overcome, they dived below a heavy metal experiment table. The bats continued to swarm overhead, but for now the friends were safe under their solid shield.&lt;br />\u201cWhat the hell are those things?!\u201d Amy panted, still checking her hair for lingering creatures.&lt;br />\u201cBats, you said it yourself.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThose are larger than any bat I\u2019ve ever seen, and their mad with bloodlust.\u201d&lt;br />Tony had a sickening suspicion as to what the beasts were, but said nothing. He had to think of a way out of here.&lt;br />\u201cAmy, in your backpack, do you have any hairspray?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWhat do you mean by that? That girls are too image conscious? Guys use hairspray, too. Do you have any in your backpack?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cDamnit, this is no time for debating sexism and gender roles. Do you have an frickin\u2019 hair spray.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYes,\u201d said Amy, handing him a bottle. \u201cThough I can\u2019t see how it\u2019s gonna help.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cJust follow me, and move fast. We\u2019ll go to the door on the other side of the room.\u201d&lt;br />He pulled out his lighter.&lt;br />\u201cReady?\u201dAmy nodded.&lt;br />Tony took a deep breath and got out from under the desk.&lt;br />He flipped open the lighter and produced a large flame. Positioning the bottle of hairspray behind it, he held down on the trigger and an arm of fire shot forward.&lt;br />\u201cTake this, you bastards!\u201d yelled Tony as he ignited clouds of the screaming bats with his improvised flamethrower. The creatures fell from the sky like tattered, fiery rags as he and Amy plowed their way through the door at the other end of the room. Just as the hairspray bottle began to sputter and the flame die, they opened the door and slipped through.&lt;br />Amy slammed the door behind her and stood their breathing heavily.&lt;br />She and Tony wearily made their way down the corridor, both too shaken to realize that their countless bite wounds had already healed.&lt;br />&lt;br />Richard and Steve stumbled through the passageways of the Umbrella Corporations\u2019 massive complex, hopelessly lost. Richard stopped and leaned against a wall, breathing heavily.&lt;br />\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, Steve. My wounds have all healed, but my head is killing me.\u201d He massaged his right temple. \u201cAnd, I need not add, we\u2019re hopelessly lost.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSame here about the healing and the headache. We\u2019ve been wandering around these halls for a half an hour at least.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI don\u2019t know what time it is. I don\u2019t know where we are. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on outside this damned building, what\u2019s happening to our friends. Goddamnit!\u201d Richard slammed his fist against a wall panel.&lt;br />The panel lit up and a portion of the wall slid open. Richard had unwittingly found a doorway.&lt;br />\u201cThat\u2019s the first time my temper has ever accomplished anything constructive,\u201d he muttered in awe.&lt;br />He and Steve warily entered the darkened room.&lt;br />&lt;br />Elsewhere in the compound, Tony and Amy were faring no better. They too were lost in the countless corridors of the Umbrella Corporation\u2019s local headquarters. Amy halted at what seemed to be a dead end. She looked around the cul de sac thoughtfully, her eyes finally settling on a small recessed control pad in one of the walls. Skillfully she broke the pad open with a colorful pin and ripped out the wires. Twisting and connecting several of those wires, she managed to circumvent the door locks. Two doors, one on either side of the hallway, opened up. Beyond them lay darkness. Amy and Tony stood looking into each of the possible routes.&lt;br />\u201cWhich do we choose?\u201d Amy asked, gnawing her lip.&lt;br />Wordlessly, Tony unsheathed a knife and laid it on the ground. He gave it a powerful spin. The blade came to rest pointing to the door on the left. He picked up the knife and nodded decisively.&lt;br />\u201cWe go left.\u201d&lt;br />The two comrades strode into the blackness beyond.&lt;br />&lt;br />Tony and Amy stumbled through the darkness.&lt;br />Richard and Steve stumbled through darkness.&lt;br />Suddenly, both pairs were blinded by a fierce white light.&lt;br />&lt;br />Richard blinked and rubbed his eyes. He found himself in the same vast conference room he had looked down upon the previous night. Now that he was standing in it, the room seemed even more staggeringly huge than it had before. The floor, polished black marble, stretched in length and width as far as a football field. The ceiling, supported by towering marble pillars, white this time, existed an unbelievable hundred feet above him. The center of the great hall still contained the black conference table, and the far wall was still dominated by the massive screen.&lt;br />Richard looked across the room, past the table, and spotted Tony and Amy. His heart leaped in his chest. Punching Steve in the shoulder and pointing to their friends, he preceded to run the width of the room and vaulted 20 feet into the air over the table, landing on his haunches between his two compatriots. Steve waited a moment and did the same. They both stood up and looked at each other.&lt;br />\u201cHow did you guys do that?\u201d Amy asked incredulously.&lt;br />\u201cWe\u2019re not exactly sure at the present time,\u201d said Steve, looking fairly surprised himself.&lt;br />\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d Tony asked Rich. \u201cWe were lost forever in those damn corridors.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI pounded a wall and found a door.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI ripped open a wall and found two doors,\u201d Amy said.&lt;br />\u201cWell kudos, sister friend.\u201d Richard said smiling, and executed an awkward high-five with the warrioress from MHC. \u201cThis is the conference room Sam and I spied on last night.\u201d Richard went on. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so empty now, though.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cIt\u2019s not as empty as you think,\u201d Steve said in a hushed voice, pointing toward the opposite wall.&lt;br />Mr. Hazzard, the fiendish corporate lawyer, and four guards had just entered.&lt;br />\u201cSeize them!\u201d Hazzard yelled upon spotting the four friends, and the soldiers rushed forward.&lt;br />Tired though they were, the friends easily dispatched the guards. They turned their attention to Hazzard.&lt;br />\u201cIs that all you have, Hazzard?\u201d Richard asked.&lt;br />\u201cNo,\u201d Hazzard smiled, \u201cthat was just to get you to lower your defenses.\u201d His tie, the same one he had been wearing the last time Richard saw him, began to glow. The geometric patterns began to swirl rapidly around within the garment. Suddenly four luminous diamond outlines, constantly changing between red and yellow, shot out of the tie and whirled through the air at the four heroes. Tony was the first to react, dodging out of the way just in time. His diamond grazed his shoulder, and a fine cut appeared. The cut immediately healed. While he was staring in disbelief, the diamond swooped around again and before he could move, opened like a pincer, surrounded him, and closed. Tony was trapped. Within a few minutes the same had happened to the other three. They stood in the middle of the hall, arms bound to their sides by the pulsating energy diamonds, and glared at Hazzard.&lt;br />\u201cYou four are not as skillful as I had heard. I can\u2019t imagine why the Captain had such trouble getting rid of you.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWait, you can\u2019t kill us!\u201d Tony yelled.&lt;br />\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cBecause we\u2019re here to help you.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cHelp us? You and your friends have destroyed half of the complex. You\u2019ve already cost us millions in damage. One member of your team, a short, stocky, dark haired boy, managed to cause an explosion which has left the power plant and two garages in ruins. He is out there in a bulldozer as we speak, turning the place into one gigantic demolition derby.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSammy!\u201d Tony said joyfully under his breath.&lt;br />Richard smiled at the thought of his maniacal little brother.&lt;br />\u201cThat couldn\u2019t be helped. You opened fire on us first.\u201d Tony explained. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re here is that we\u2019re trying to stop a traitor from taking over Umbrella.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cAnd even if I believe there is a traitor, why should I believe you are here to help?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell that\u2019s simple. You\u2019re familiar with the old saying, \u2018the devil you know . . .\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSorry. I can\u2019t very well believe that four sworn enemies of this corporation have traveled here, destroying everything in their path, to save the CEO. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to kill you.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNo! You don\u2019t understand,\u201d protested Tony. \u201cSilas Blake is the real power behind Umbrella. For some time now he has been controlling your CEO and founder with some sort of brainwashing machine.\u201d&lt;br />Hazaard gave Tony an odd look and said nothing for a moment. Finally he spoke.&lt;br />\u201cI know.\u201d&lt;br />The four friends were speechless.&lt;br />\u201cYou see, I function as a corporate lawyer. It doesn\u2019t matter to me from whom my orders come so long as I get paid.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWhat about the goals of the Umbrella Corporation?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI could care less about our goals so long as the company prospers. And just between you four and myself, I prefer Silas as CEO. Under his rule Umbrella\u2019s efficiency has quadrupled. We have sensible plans. We have direction. This means profits are up, which means my pay goes up. You think I care about the dreams of some crackpot old man? I care about money! And as such I cannot let you live. Your death means cash for me.\u201d&lt;br />A strange gleam had come into Hazzard\u2019s dark eyes. He looked crazed. Eventually he shook his head, straightened his glowing tie, and steadied his gaze.&lt;br />\u201cNow, in the interests of the Umbrella Corporation, I\u2019ve got some shredding to do.\u201d&lt;br />As he said this, four more diamonds melted out of Hazzard\u2019s tie and levitated into the air. Hazzard raised his hands, palms up, as if shrugging, and the diamonds floated above them. These energy shapes were about the size of playing cards. With a stunningly white smile he flicked his fingers and sent the razor-edged light diamonds whirring through the air at the four friends. All four heroes simultaneously closed their eyes and gritted their teeth, expecting the worst.&lt;br />The diamonds were closing in, only a few feet from the captives\u2019 faces when suddenly they shattered, burst into tiny shards of light in quick succession. Across the conference hall, Caitlin lowered her laser rifle and smiled in satisfaction. She ran the length of the room to her friends, skidded to a halt, and lowered her weapon at Hazzard\u2019s midriff. Cait looked to her friends on the floor, bound by energy diamonds.&lt;br />\u201cGood thing I have such impeccable aim. What would you do without me?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cCait! That was amazing!\u201d Amy yelled.&lt;br />\u201cAll right, Hazzy,\u201d Cait said, turning to the burly lawyer. \u201cCall off your diamonds.\u201d&lt;br />Hazzard glared at her, but relented, and the diamonds, apparently telepathically controlled, flickered and disappeared from around the four friends. They stood up and massaged their arms. They then took turns hugging Caitlin, who would have hugged back if she didn\u2019t have to keep her sights trained on Hazzard. After Cait\u2019s valiant rescue had been praised several times over, Richard was the first to get down to business.&lt;br />\u201cAll right, Mr. Hazzard,\u201d he said, folding his arms and staring menacingly at the lawyer, \u201cI think now is the time when you take us to see the person who should be in charge of the Umbrella Corporation.\u201d&lt;br />Caitlin waved him on with her rifle, and Hazzard grudgingly led them out of the conference room through a secret passage and into the heart of the complex, a small control room filled with an array of monitors. Seated in a large chair in the center of the room was the man they had come to see.&lt;br />Doctor Thaddeus Trans was dressed as impeccably as he had been the previous night. This time, however, he was in a dazzling white three-piece suit, crimson tie, with an Umbrella Corp. logo tiepin, and his trademark stained-glass shades. However, there was something out of place about the man. His smooth, effeminate face was slack. His mouth hung open, and he was not moving.&lt;br />\u201cSteve, check him out.\u201d Tony said. \u201cCait, keep an eye on Hazzard.\u201d&lt;br />Steve warily approached the slumped figure in the chair. He put two fingers to the man\u2019s throat and was silent for a moment.&lt;br />\u201cWell,\u201d Steve said over his shoulder, \u201che\u2019s not dead.\u201d He continued examining Trans. \u201cHe appears to be catatonic.\u201d&lt;br />Steve turned around to face the group.&lt;br />\u201cI can\u2019t explain it, but his vital signs, though constant, are minimal. He\u2019s effectively in a coma.\u201d Steve patted Trans limp body on the back. \u201cAt least he\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d&lt;br />The body suddenly slumped forward, tipping off the chair. Steve stood impassively while everyone else jumped back in shock.&lt;br />\u201cHo, ho, ho, what\u2019s this?\u201d Steve asked as everyone calmed down. He stooped down to examine the back of the doctor\u2019s head. There was a small hemispherical mechanical device embedded there. It was about the size of a golf ball and had a glowing red light at its center.&lt;br />Richard turned to Hazaard. \u201cI take it this is how Silas has been controlling him.\u201d&lt;br />Hazaard said nothing.&lt;br />\u201cHow do we fix him?\u201d&lt;br />Still Hazaard was silent.&lt;br />\u201cCaitlin,\u201d Richard said, glancing at the hot girl holding the rifle to his right.&lt;br />Caitlin nodded in understanding and lowered the weapon from Hazzard\u2019s stomach to his groin.&lt;br />Hazzard\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he began.&lt;br />\u201cOh she would. She once nearly blinded me with toothpicks, and I\u2019m a friend.\u201d&lt;br />Caitlin cocked the gun for emphasis and nodded at Richard\u2019s words.&lt;br />Hazzard gulped. \u201cAlright. Alright. There is a de-activation switch on the left side of the device, near the base, where it connects with the skull.\u201d He looked warily at the gun Caitlin was holding. \u201cNow would you please point that somewhere else?\u201d&lt;br />Caitlin obliged him by fixing the barrel of the weapon between his eyes.&lt;br />Richard walked over to Steve and together they studied the mechanical half-orb. Steve found the switch they were looking for and was about the release Trans from his involuntary slumber when Richard stopped him.&lt;br />\u201cWait. Tony, give me a blade, please.\u201d&lt;br />Tony stepped forward and handed Richard a dagger. Richard, in turn, placed the knife at Trans\u2019 throat. Steve looked at him curiously.&lt;br />\u201cWhen he snaps out of the coma we don\u2019t know what state of mind he\u2019ll be in or how dangerous he could be. Think of this as insurance.\u201d&lt;br />Steve shrugged, waited for Richard\u2019s nod, and then flipped the switch.&lt;br />&lt;br />Thaddeus Trans awoke and glanced around him. The hazy figures slowly came into focus, and he became aware of the blade at his throat.&lt;br />He looked from Richard, kneeling beside him with the knife at his neck, to Tony, standing slightly apart and peering grimly at the spectacle.&lt;br />\u201cWell,\u201d Trans smiled winningly, \u201cWe finally meet.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />Trans went on: \u201cI\u2019m afraid you find me at a disadvantage. I am unable to recall the events leading up to this unique situation. Would you mind telling me the date and time?\u201d&lt;br />Tony checked his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s November the 25th, close to midnight.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cOh my. The last clear memory I have is falling asleep in late October. I don\u2019t suppose any among those present could enlighten me as to the true nature of this most peculiar phenomenon.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThese delinquents barged into the complex,\u201d Hazzard began, \u201ccausing irreparable and costly damage and---\u201d he would have gone on but was silenced. His words trailed off in a grunt of pain as Caitlin struck him in the jaw with the butt of her rifle. Hazzard\u2019s eyes rolled up and he collapsed in a limp bundle at her feet.&lt;br />\u201cSorry. That guy was beginning to bother me.\u201d&lt;br />Richard turned his attention away from Caitlin\u2019s shocking display of violence back to the amnesiac doctor whom he was currently threatening with a knife.&lt;br />\u201cAllow me to elucidate, Doctor. But first, why not take a seat.\u201d Richard said helping Trans back into his chair. Caitlin had left Hazaard unconscious in the doorway and now aimed her weapon at the seated CEO. Richard was thus able to remove the blade from Trans\u2019 throat. He handed it back to Tony and faced Trans.&lt;br />\u201cFor some time now, Doctor- a little over a month, if your memory is correct- you have been under an advanced form of mind control. Using this,\u201d Richard tossed him the brainwashing device, \u201cyour lieutenant Silas Blake has had you as his pawn through a sort of hypnosis. In that time he has changed many of the policies of Umbrella, declared a personal vendetta against my friends and me, and placed himself as the new leader of Ninja Pirate Incorporated, disposing the Captain. He had planned to bring the world to its knees with an uncontrollable epidemic and then hold sway with a plethora of drugs, beginning in Western Massachusetts and from there taking out every metropolis on the eastern seaboard.\u201d&lt;br />He let this sink in.&lt;br />\u201cWell I suppose I should have seen this coming, considering . . . but never mind that for now. Carry on, son.\u201d&lt;br />Richard nodded and continued. \u201cMy friends and I uncovered his plot and while stopping his goal were made privy to his control of you. Realizing that Silas was too dangerous to continue leading Umbrella, we stormed your stronghold and freed you from his control.&lt;br />Trans was silent for a time.&lt;br />\u201cYou and your friends have taken some fantastic risks going up against Silas and coming here. I must thank you for freeing me. Now, is there anything else I need be told?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYes. To escape death, Silas signed over control of NP Inc. to us, breaking its subsidiary ties to the Umbrella Corporation. We trust you\u2019ll honor this agreement.\u201d&lt;br />Trans chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not, dear boy. Ninja Pirate Incorporated is the communications wing of the Umbrella Corporation. It handles our television and radio stations, websites, movie studios, and publishing department, into which fall all our books, magazines, and newspapers. It is far to crucial to our cause to hand over based on the desperate acts of a dying man.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cKeep in mind, Doctor, you are at gunpoint.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cAm I now?\u201d said Trans with a smirk.&lt;br />Richard whirled around and saw Hazzard send his razor diamonds whizzing at the gathered heroes. One caught Caitlin in the hand, causing her to drop her rifle. The other projectiles hit Tony, Steve, and Amy, all in the stomach. One after another they fell, clutching bleeding wounds.&lt;br />\u201cYou bastard!\u201d Richard threw himself at Trans, but the doctor moved in a blur, impossibly fast, and struck him with a sharp backhanded blow that sent him sprawling. Richard dragged his knuckles across his lips, wiping away a trail of blood and fixed Trans with a fiery glare.&lt;br />\u201cYou see, boy, why it pays to have a lawyer? You should never leave home without one.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThey didn\u2019t!\u201d&lt;br />Trans glanced up just in time to see Mrs. Sez and her wonderdog, Martha come charging into the room. Martha threw herself upon Hazzard, tearing his sleek black suit to shreds with her teeth and claws. Mrs. Sez, meanwhile, flew through the air at Trans, laying him out with a powerful kick. She helped Caitlin up and, pulling a first aid kit out of a bag she had slung over her shoulder, bandaged her daughter\u2019s hand with the unflinching care of a concerned mother.&lt;br />Richard stood, picked up the rifle Caitlin had dropped, and pointed it at Trans.&lt;br />\u201cMy friends are dead because of you,\u201d he growled.&lt;br />\u201cAre you sure about that, boy?\u201d Trans asked.&lt;br />Richard looked over his shoulder. His four friends were getting slowly to their feet; the seemingly fatal wounds they had received had healed. Richard turned back to Trans.&lt;br />\u201cWhat the hell is going on? What did you do to us?\u201d&lt;br />The doctor merely smiled.&lt;br />Caitlin\u2019s mother, having tended to her daughter\u2019s wound, strode over to where Trans was lying on the ground.&lt;br />\u201cMy name is attorney Robin Szewyck. I\u2019m here acting as legal council to these kids. I\u2019d like to discuss the matter of their newly acquired property.\u201d&lt;br />Trans smiled smugly at her, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to take that up with my lawyer.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cOh, I plan to.\u201d And with that, Mrs. Sez walked over to the corner of the room where Hazzard was lying, paralyzed with fear, staring at the snarling dog before him.&lt;br />\u201cGood girl, Martha,\u201d Mrs. Sez cooed and patted the canine\u2019s head.&lt;br />\u201cNow, Mr. Hazzard, is it? I\u2019m Robin Sezwyk, attorney at law, and there are some legal matters I need to discuss. C\u2019mon Caitlin, I\u2019ll need you to cover me while I deal with this sleaze.\u201d She turned to Hazzard, \u201cYou give lawyers a bad name.\u201d&lt;br />Then mother, daughter, dog, and villain all walked back into the conference room and Mrs. Sez began to lay out her case.&lt;br />Steve and Amy glanced around.&lt;br />\u201cWell,\u201d said Amy, \u201clooks like you guys have got everything under control here. I\u2019ll be heading back to me dorm. Lordy, I need a drink. Steve, you\u2019re free to join me if you give me a ride.\u201d&lt;br />Steve winked at Tony and Richard. \u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d&lt;br />Arm in arm he and Amy strolled out of the control room.&lt;br />Richard and Tony were left alone in the dark with Dr. Thaddeus Trans, the madman who had been after them for months.&lt;br />Trans rose from the floor and took his seat.&lt;br />Full minutes stretched out as the enemies just stared at each other. Finally, Tony broke the silence.&lt;br />\u201cWell, I thought they\u2019d never leave. Now that it\u2019s just you and us, we\u2019ve got some pressing questions which we believe you can answer.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell then, ask away, my lad, ask away. But let me warn you: The answers that you seek may very well be more than you bargained for.\u201d He leaned back and smiled benevolently. \u201cBut ask away.\u201d&lt;br />Richard and Tony looked at each other, took a single deep breath, and began.&lt;br />\u201cI fought Silas today,\u201d Tony said, \u201cHe was able to counter my every move. Other opponents have been challenges, but this time he had the same attacks, the same fighting style. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cHe was also able to beat Steve at catch. He\u2019s the first one to do that.\u201d Rich went on where Tony left off. \u201cHe\u2019s as strong as I am, and as hilariously deviant.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cHe uses the same slang as we do. He has the same beliefs as we do. He knew everything about us.\u201d Tony finished.&lt;br />\u201cWe want to know how that\u2019s possible. How much surveillance do you have us under?\u201d Richard asked.&lt;br />The unnatural smile on Trans\u2019 smooth face widened.&lt;br />\u201cYou two picked a good question to start with. I assure you that surveillance was not the way we managed to make Silas so much like you. You see, Silas is more than like you. He is you.\u201d&lt;br />The two friends were speechless.&lt;br />I must admit the culmination of this plan came about after months of deception. Do you know the real purpose behind the attack and take over of your friend Andrew\u2019s school? It was not, as it seemed to be, an attempt to corrupt thousands of young people. That was an added bonus. The real goal behind that scheme was simply to attain samples of your DNA.\u201d He noted the looks of disbelief on their faces, sighed, and tried a different track. \u201cFor years we had been following you and your friends. Market research indicated that you were our key archenemy demographic. As such, we decided to fight fire with fire. We at Umbrella thought that the best way to stop you was with yourselves. So over the course of several months we collected tissue and fluid samples from each of you, and combined them to create our ultimate weapon, the boy you know as Silas Blake.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSo Silas is a combined clone?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cIn a manner of speaking, yes.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cBut you underestimated him. Your fire got out of control.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYes. That is why I said it was not surprising that Silas tried to take over Umbrella. It seems the desire to ruin this corporation exists on a genetic level. But, that doesn\u2019t matter, now, as he\u2019s dead.\u201d&lt;br />Tony and Richard looked at each other.&lt;br />\u201cWe never said he was dead.\u201d Tony said.&lt;br />Trans\u2019 smile melted away.&lt;br />\u201cHe\u2019s still out there?! Do you realize the danger he poses?!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYes, we do. But we\u2019ve faced off with him before and won. You, on the other hand, failed to stop him. The way we see it, you\u2019re in a lot more danger than we are.\u201d Richard explained.&lt;br />Trans\u2019 smile returned. \u201cVery well, boy. But I\u2019d imagine this will come back to haunt you.&lt;br />\u201cNow, what else do you need to ask me?\u201d&lt;br />The friends took a few moments to come to grips with the information they had just been given, and then explained their second question.&lt;br />\u201cOn the way here my friend Amy and I became lost in the maze of corridors. We were walking through a dark room, feeling our way along when I accidentally opened up cages that lined the walls. The cages were filled with large, shrieking bats. The creatures descended upon us in a swooping, crawling cloud. We were both bitten on our necks. After the bite we both felt impossibly alert, but dizzy and nauseous. Later on, when fighting Mr. Hazzard, my arm was cut deeply, but healed within seconds. Just now I received a fatal wound from another energy diamond, yet, again, within minutes I was on my feet again, completely healed. What is going on?\u201d&lt;br />Trans nodded understandingly at Tony, but did not answer. Instead he turned to Richard who was staring oddly at Tony.&lt;br />\u201cWhat about you, my young, golden-haired adversary? Did you have a similar experience?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI don\u2019t know how you could know this, but yes. Steve and I were attacked by a large dog. We managed to knock it down an elevator shaft, but it gave us both grievous bites. They soon healed, however, along with our other wounds. And although we too felt alert and sensitive, we both had tremendous headaches. Now what the hell is going on?\u201d&lt;br />Trans\u2019 grinned. \u201cYou two are bright; you can figure this one out. What have you been debating about online? What specific mythologies have occupied your thoughts for weeks?\u201d&lt;br />Tony and Rich would not accept it.&lt;br />\u201cNo.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou and Amy were bitten by bats, Tony,\u201d Trans said with glee, \u201cvampire bats. And Richard, you and Steve were not attacked by a dog, but, indeed, by a werewolf. Congratulations, gentlemen. You are both monsters!\u201d&lt;br />The two boys were stunned.&lt;br />\u201cAlthough, the lycanthropic and vampiric viruses were not the only things transferred through the bites. Also in the saliva of those beasts were psycho-emotional chemicals. You are both now subject to heightened aggression and uncontrollable fits of rage.&lt;br />\u201cI offer you now places of honor in the Umbrella Corporation. Join me and rule as princes! Think of all we could accomplish. Join me!\u201d&lt;br />Tony and Richard found words.&lt;br />\u201cNever!\u201d they said in unison. \u201cWe want no part of your demented dream. We will never join you!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou fools!\u201d Trans snapped back angrily. \u201cYou do not understand the gifts I have granted you!\u201d He began to shake. Thin, spidery veins began to appear and pulse on his pale forehead, neck, and hands. Black veins. His voice reached a startling shriek. Richard and Tony stumbled backward in fear as he continued. \u201cYou think you can turn your back on me!? I\u2019ll crush you! I\u2019ll make you pray for death before the end!\u201d&lt;br />He seemed to catch himself and began to calm down. The veins receded. He stopped shaking. Trans adjusted his tie and spoke softly.&lt;br />\u201cBe that as it may. We will see in time how you decide.\u201d&lt;br />At this moment, Caitlin came running in.&lt;br />\u201cGuys! My mom just forced Hazzard into a settlement. We won Ninja Pirate Inc!\u201d&lt;br />Richard and Tony did not respond, so she continued. \u201cBecause Trans was not of sound body and mind- not the you ever are, you whacko\u201d she added, glaring at Trans- \u201cSilas was official CEO anyway. Regardless of the reasons for the doctor\u2019s coma, Silas, as vice-president, automatically took over until the doctor became well. Thus, any decisions made, or contracts signed, by him are legitimate and binding. Isn\u2019t that awesome?\u201d&lt;br />Tony and Rich managed smiles, even after receiving such disturbing revelations from Trans. They turned and hugged Cait.&lt;br />Taking advantage of the diversion, Trans leaned forward and pressed a large red button on one of the consoles. Alarms went off. Red lights flashed.&lt;br />The three friends whirled around to face the mad doctor.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019ve just initiated the self destruct sequence. Already, minor explosions are slowly tearing the building apart. When the fire hits the boiler room and the chemical vats in the sub-basement the whole complex will explode, leveling the area. I need to make my escape now, but I leave you with this: You two may think you\u2019re still regular boys. You\u2019re not. You\u2019re no longer human. You are dangerous, uncontrollable animals. You\u2019ll find no solace, no rest out there,\u201d he indicated the outside with a sweeping gesture of his arm. \u201cOnly I can help you. You have shunned my attempts thus far, but we\u2019ll see whose will is ultimately stronger. But for now, without further ado, I unleash you upon the world.\u201d With that the seat of his chair dropped and a tunnel opened in the floor beneath him. He disappeared with a cackle and a whoosh.&lt;br />Tony reacted fast, but not fast enough. His two throwing knives embedded themselves in the back of Trans\u2019 chair; the doctor was gone.&lt;br />Tony and Richard turned to Caitlin.&lt;br />\u201cCait,\u201d Rich said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out of here. Get your mother and Martha and get out of the building. Once you make it out, round everyone up and get them as far away from the complex as possible.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWhat about you two,\u201d Cait asked. \u201cAnd what did Trans\u2019 mean, \u2018You\u2019re animals\u2019?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNo time to explain, but Rich and I are now a werewolf and a vampire, respectively. We\u2019ll be fine here, but we have some unfinished business to take care of.\u201d&lt;br />He unceremoniously flung Caitlin out the door. When she had gone, he turned to Rich.&lt;br />\u201cYou ready?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cFor what?\u201d Rich asked. \u201cWhat unfinished business is there?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cListen. You remember the movie Resident Evil? Umbrella supposedly closed their subterranean base for good, but it opened up, infected the city, and wacky, mayhem ensued. I don\u2019t trust Trans\u2019 self-destruct sequence. What if something deadly escapes the explosions or some dangerous technology is left salvageable? What if Blake\u2019s viruses survive? I can\u2019t take that chance. I need to stay and make damned sure this accursed place gets blowed up properly!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou remember what Trans said about violent tendencies? I think you---\u201d&lt;br />\u201cHey, potato, potahto.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cTony, that doesn\u2019t apply---\u201d&lt;br />The intense Italian broke a pipe off the wall and gripped it meaningfully. \u201cYou gonna stand there nay-saying, or are you gonna help me smash stuff?\u201d He swung the heavy pipe at a computer and the machine burst into sparking shards of glass and plastic.&lt;br />Richard shrugged, flipped over a table, and threw a computer across the room.&lt;br />\u201cWhen you\u2019re right you\u2019re right,\u201d he admitted as the control room collapsed into chaotic destruction.&lt;br />&lt;br />Explosions sounded behind them as, a half an hour later, Tony and Richard walked at a leisurely pace out of the burning ruins that were once the Umbrella Corporation\u2019s headquarters. Chunks of flaming brick and wood flew through the air around them.&lt;br />\u201cWell, I gotta say, that\u2019s pretty odd that we spent weeks arguing over monsters only to become those very monsters ourselves,\u201d mused Rich.&lt;br />\u201cCoincidence? I think not!\u201d said Tony excitedly.&lt;br />Their dialogue was punctuated by the rumbling explosions behind them. The old factory buildings were creaking and groaning in agony as the two friends reached the bridge that spanned the canal.&lt;br />\u201cI imagine killing zombies will be a lot easier, not to mention a lot more fun, with our new powers,\u201d laughed Tony.&lt;br />\u201cYou said it, amigo.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cJust remember, as I am far more powerful than you, don\u2019t be shy to yell out for my help if you ever get in trouble in battle. Furthermoreover, my new, exalted position makes me a sure candidate for CEO of our newly acquired Ninja Pirate Inc. You can be my secretary. Werewolves traditionally serve vampires.\u201d&lt;br />Tony paused and looked around. Rich had stopped walking several yards back. He stood there glaring at Tony. Tony walked back to where his friend was standing.&lt;br />Richard spoke angrily. \u201cWait just a minute, you patronizing bastard! Vampires are not better than werewolves!\u201d He growled at Tony and brushed roughly past him, shouting over his shoulder as he strode across the bridge. \u201cI will not be your secretary. I will not ask for your help. And if you think you can just glide into CEO position you\u2019re sadly mistaken, my friend. You try to take over Ninja Pirate Inc and you will have one fuck of a fight on your hands.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWhy wait?\u201d&lt;br />Richard stopped He turned around. He had nearly crossed the bridge, but Tony had remained standing dark and calm and deathly still on the other side. Though he was more than 60 feet away from him, he had heard Tony\u2019s words as if they were whispered in his ear. Richard snarled, then cocked his head to one side.&lt;br />\u201cAre you saying you want to settle this here and now?\u201d&lt;br />A light snow had begun to fall, swirling around the two warriors in impish gusts, urging them on to mayhem.&lt;br />\u201cYou werewolves aren\u2019t as dumb as you look. I do want to settle our little quarrel now.&lt;br />Tony squared his shoulders. His eyes grew blood red. His forehead expanded and wrinkled in a predatory squint. His jaws and teeth grew. He seemed to stretch, like a shadow, to lengthen somehow. A mist rose off the canal and partially enveloped him.&lt;br />\u201cCan you think of a better time?\u201d Tony asked&lt;br />Richard looked up at the silver clouds draped across the sky. The wind picked up, revealing a full moon.&lt;br />\u201cNo, can\u2019t say as I can.\u201d&lt;br />Richard threw back his head and laughed as the moonlight struck him. His laugh deepened and turned into an eerie howl. He had begun to transform. Richard\u2019s eyes blazed an unearthly yellow. His mouth and nose slowly elongated into a snout. Veins bulged all over his body. His skin seemed to melt as his bones and muscles reformed. His ears became pointed. Fangs sprouted from his thick jaw. Hair began to grow all over him. His hands turned into claws. His shirt tore off his body. His pants ripped, shoes burst, belt snapped. After a few moments the transformation was complete.&lt;br />He now stood six feet tall, even hunched over. His knees had reversed themselves, his knuckles dragged on the ground. He was nearly five feet wide at the shoulder and covered in thick, golden brown hair.&lt;br />Richard\u2019s slavering jaws split into a grotesque abomination of a grin as he lowered his gaze from the moon above and looked straight at Tony. Glowing yellow eyes met blood red ones. Both boys stifled a shiver staring into the ferocity before them.&lt;br />\u201cLet this be our final debate!\u201d Tony yelled.&lt;br />\u201cYou vampires and your theatrics,\u201d muttered Rich. Then, he let out a roar that resounded across the barren industrial landscape like a peal of thunder and charged. Bounding across the snow covered bridge on all fours he reached Tony in an instant. He leaped up into the air and brought his razor sharp claws slicing down in a blur. He hit nothing but eddying snow flakes. Tony appeared suddenly behind him, and a look of pained surprise masked Richard\u2019s face as he whirled around just in time to catch a jarring roundhouse kick to the face which sent him sprawling, skidding through the snow. He rose and shook white powder out of his fur like a huge, shaggy dog. He rubbed his heavy lupine jaw with a gnarled, clawed hand and gazed in admiration at his enemy.&lt;br />\u201cYou vampires are fast.\u201d He feinted to the right, dodged to the left, and caught Tony off guard. Richard tore into him with a bestial fury, connecting one, two, three devastating blows before locking his powerful paws onto the vampire\u2019s arms, lifting him off the ground and throwing him bodily toward the ruined factory.&lt;br />\u201cYou\u2019re not too bright, though.\u201d&lt;br />Tony flew through the air, his black leather jacket swirling around him, finally crashing through a window and landing hard on the cement floor. He was dazed and aching, but he was tough. Tony arose and walked through the massive front doorway, surrounded by flames.&lt;br />Richard was waiting for him.&lt;br />\u201cYou know,\u201d Richard asked Tony, \u201cwhy you won\u2019t win? Because even if vampires have all that fancy magic, they don\u2019t get it for decades after they\u2019re bitten. It comes from practice and experience. You\u2019re too new at this. I, on the other hand, have my strength and speed from day one.\u201d&lt;br />Tony said nothing. He noticed some shards of glass sticking out of his arm and, gritting his teeth, pulled them slowly out. One was five inches long.&lt;br />\u201cRapid healing or not,\u201d jibed the werewolf, \u201cthat\u2019s gotta hurt like a bitch.\u201d&lt;br />Tony took a breath. \u201cThere\u2019re two things you\u2019re forgetting. First, I have an inhuman pain tolerance to begin with.\u201d He paused, wrenched out the final shard with a flourish and dropped it to the ground. \u201cThe second thing you\u2019re forgetting is that even if I don\u2019t have any vampire magic yet, I still have my own skills to draw from.\u201d&lt;br />In a flash he pulled three throwing knives from a wrist sheath and sent them whirring through the air at Richard. Tony\u2019s aim was true and his blades sharp; all three knives pierced Richard\u2019s thick hide.&lt;br />The werewolf yelped in pain and quickly pulled out the blades with his teeth. The moment\u2019s hesitation was all it took for Tony to be on him, punching, kicking, scratching. Richard was surprised and Tony got in numerous good shots, but it didn\u2019t take long for the werewolf to galvanize into action. He caught Tony\u2019s fist in the air and with a fearsome pressure, snapped the vampire\u2019s metacarpals like matchsticks. He brought his bulky arms crashing down on the vampire\u2019s unprotected back while his opponent was hunched over in pain from his crushed hand. Tony hit the ground hard and lay there waiting for his bones to heal. Richard stepped back and panted, wincing in pain as he listened to the clicking sound of his ribs mending. After a moment more of rest, the combatants faced each other.&lt;br />\u201cI think this might take longer to settle than I thought,\u201d Tony breathed.&lt;br />\u201cTrue. Hitting you is like pounding a brick wall.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou\u2019re no slouch yourself. You really caught me off guard with that feint.\u201d&lt;br />For a moment friendly understanding glowed between the two comrades. Suddenly they inexplicably convulsed, straightened, and yelled at the same time:&lt;br />\u201cWerewolves are better!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cVampires are better!\u201d&lt;br />And with that, they began their brawl anew. Weary and aching, despite their rapid healing abilities, the combatants nonetheless charged at each other with an ungodly fury. They doggedly traded blows, relentlessly battering each other. Punching and kicking, biting and clawing, they rolled over and over, neither asking for nor giving quarter.&lt;br />Their battle raged across the bridge to the old factory, up and down flights of stairs, around corners, through doorways and back out again.&lt;br />Tony moved almost faster than Richard could follow.&lt;br />Every one of Richard\u2019s punches made Tony feel as though a wrecking ball had hit him.&lt;br />The din of their combat, groans, screams, triumphant yells, grunts of exertion, rose above the creaking of the buildings and the crackling of the fire.&lt;br />Eventually they made their way around the main building and back to the front doors. Tony swung a chop at Richard\u2019s neck, but the beast dodged and sunk his teeth into Tony\u2019s arm. Tony gasped in pain as two-inch-long teeth tore through muscle and ligament. The vampire stopped attacking to cradle his ruined arm as it healed. Richard took advantage of the momentary let up in Tony\u2019s attack. He grabbed Tony\u2019s collar and, bringing him close, head butted the vampire ferociously three times, splitting his lips and breaking his nose.&lt;br />\u201cWho\u2019s the better monster now?\u201d Richard growled.&lt;br />Tony spit out a tooth and managed a fierce, bloody smile.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019m not through with you yet, shaggy.\u201d&lt;br />Rich\u2019s yellow eyes widened in shock as Tony\u2019s knee connected with his groin. He loosened his grip on the vampire and sank to his knees. Tony slammed a knife into the beast\u2019s neck, stepped back, and with a fiery intensity struck Richard square on the chin with an astounding uppercut, sending him crashing into the front of the building. Richard\u2019s heavy form, coupled with the power of Tony\u2019s hit, cracked the brick fa\u00e7ade, and Richard crumpled to the ground.&lt;br />The warriors rested for the second time since their epic battle had begun.&lt;br />Gradually, Richard rose to his hind paws.&lt;br />The opponents locked eyes for what they new would be the last time. It ended here.&lt;br />They had just started their final charge when the old factory behind them finally gave. The whole building exploded outward toward the canal with a tremendous force. Chunks of the front wall flew through the air. Richard and Tony were launched halfway across the bridge, burned and wounded. Flaming bits of the factory hit the oily waters of the canal and ignited them. The water, so contaminated with volatile chemicals, lit the area in a spectacular blaze.&lt;br />Tony and Richard lay unconscious for five minutes, no more than two yards from each other. Eventually they began to move. Gingerly, feebly, they stretched their limbs as their bodies forced shrapnel back out through their skin, healed their burns, and reset broken bones. Though the healing was soon through, the agony was still very much present.&lt;br />Tony stood up.&lt;br />Richard stood up.&lt;br />They could see there was only one way this fight would end. They advanced.&lt;br />\u201cI have to go for a kill,\u201d both thought.&lt;br />Tony drew and eleven-inch knife, bared his glistening white fangs, and hissed.&lt;br />Richard growled, a low, rumbling, dangerous sound, and trudged forward.&lt;br />The werewolf wrapped his claws around the vampire\u2019s throat and head, cutting off the hiss, and began to twist. He was trying to rip his foe\u2019s head off.&lt;br />The vampire\u2019s blade was silver. He rammed it deep into his opponent\u2019s belly. The werewolf\u2019s growl was replaced by the sizzling of flesh: Richard\u2019s allergic reaction to the shining metal. Tony twisted the blade up and around, searching for the heart.&lt;br />Just as the mists of death were clouding over the combatants\u2019 eyes, their lives flashed before them. Improv club, Python skits in front of the school. Celebrity Jeopardy, parties over Tony\u2019s, porno at Richard\u2019s. Countless movies, games, walks, and chats came flooding back to the two friends.&lt;br />Through the haze, Richard saw Tony rambling on in the front seat of Pachuco.&lt;br />\u201cBut I digress,\u201d Tony was saying, \u201cI love pop tarts.\u201d&lt;br />Tony could see himself standing next to Richard one fine spring day under the shade of a tree.&lt;br />\u201cLovely weather,\u201d Tony said.&lt;br />Rich replied, \u201cIt\u2019s giving me an erection!\u201d&lt;br />Simultaneously, Richard released Tony and Tony withdrew his dagger. They hugged breathlessly on the rusted bridge over the flaming canal amid the falling snow.&lt;br />\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s better.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cRight, because I think we\u2019ve both proven we\u2019re about equal.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWe coulda learned something from Steve and Amy,\u201d said Tony.&lt;br />Richard looked across the canal to Steve\u2019s van, in which a Goth-chic Amy, clearly embracing her new vampirism, and Steve, halfway between human self and full transformation, were apparently seeing how far they could stick their tongues down each other\u2019s throats.&lt;br />\u201cOh, okay, said Rich, unraveling and foot of tongue and advancing on Tony.&lt;br />\u201cTake one more step and I\u2019ll stab you in the eye,\u201d said Tony drawing his blade. \u201cI meant we should see past all this nonsense of werewolves and vampires. We\u2019re friends, plain and simple, and always will be.\u201d&lt;br />And with that, the two friends limped slowly across the bridge towards home.&lt;br />&lt;br />As Richard and Tony made their way to their respective rides, a single, unnoticed periscope slid silently beneath the flaming waters of the canal.&lt;br />Below the surface a highly advanced mini-sub hovered, glowing, in the murky depths.&lt;br />Dr. Thaddeus Trans released his finger from the periscope control button and the screen before him went black.&lt;br />He was seated in a large, high-backed, swiveling chair, surrounded by computer consoles which flooded the interior of the submarine with a dull red light. Trans\u2019 effeminate face grew grim in that light.&lt;br />\u201cVery well,\u201d he said angrily. \u201cSo those two wish to squander the gifts I have bestowed upon them? They wish to turn their backs on my generous offer? \u2018Tis a shame. Their willpower is astounding. They were capable of breaking the influence of my psycho-emotional chemicals. They would have made invaluable generals for my zombie army. Now I suppose I really will have to kill them.&lt;br />\u201cSung Li, get me Philipe Abattoir on the line,\u201d Trans spoke into an intercom.&lt;br />A flawlessly beautiful Asian face appeared on the monitor in front of him. Her skin was pale and without even the smallest imperfection, like porcelain. Her hair was sleekest ebon, the same color as her seductive almond eyes, and her teasing, pouting lips.&lt;br />Sung Li was Trans\u2019 chief assistant and head interrogator for the Umbrella Corporation. She was an unmatched martial artist and possessed a fantastic scientific mind.&lt;br />\u201cYou wish to eliminate those two boys you turned into monsters, Dr.? That\u2019s a shame, they were cute.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cSadly yes, Sung Li. They declined my offer, what other choice do I have?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cWell, instead of having that leering animal Abattoir kill them, why not have him merely capture them and turn them over to me?\u201d&lt;br />Trans chuckled. \u201cYou think you\u2019d be able to convince them to change their minds?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI am sure of it, Dr. My talents have never failed you before.\u201d&lt;br />The wicked doctor smiled, thinking of Li\u2019s torture methods. \u201cIt\u2019s true, Sung Li. You can be very . . . persuasive. Very well, then. Patch me through to Abattoir.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYes sir, Dr. Thank you sir.\u201d&lt;br />Sung Li\u2019s face disappeared, to replaced by one not nearly as pleasant.&lt;br />Philipe Abattoir did not work expressly for the Umbrella Corporation. He was a bounty hunter. An ugly term, but it fit Abattoir well. He grinned revoltingly at Trans and spoke to him through a heavy Cajun accent.&lt;br />\u201cWell, well, Doc. How can Ah be of \u2018sistahnce today?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cAbattoir, I need you to bring in two bounties. I\u2019m sending the files over to you now.\u201d&lt;br />The Cajun perused the documents.&lt;br />\u201cMon jou, these lil\u2019 ones be nuthin\u2019 but chillins. I laak hurtin\u2019 chillins.&lt;br />\u201cBe careful, Abattoir, they\u2019re more than they appear.\u201d&lt;br />Abattoir read on.&lt;br />\u201cAh, you\u2019n raaght about that, Doc. A werewolf anna vampah? Be a good challenge.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cAnd how goes the search for Silas Blake?\u201d&lt;br />Abattoir frowned. \u201cWell, Ah get him soonah oh latah. He a crafty devil, though. Already killed two ah mah men.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cMake sure you don\u2019t harm any of these bounties too much. I want them brought in alive, no disintegrations.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cAs you wish,\u201d said Abattoir, looking disappointed.&lt;br />\u201cDon\u2019t fail me, Abattoir; there\u2019s too much at stake.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cOh, Ah bring dem in soon, Doc, Ah gah-rahn-tee.\u201d&lt;br />The screen went dark again.&lt;br />Trans leaned back in his chair and mused on the night\u2019s events.&lt;br />\u201cA traitor revealed and two new recruits. That\u2019s worth the loss of one ramshackle headquarters. Meanwhile, our enemies are still unaware of our true plan, which is right now moving ahead of schedule. This is promising to be a banner year for Umbrella.\u201d&lt;br />He chuckled quietly in the dark as his mini-sub sped off into the inky waters of the canal.&lt;br />&lt;br />Richard trudged wearily up to his front door. This had truly been a long day. He called out as he stepped inside his cluttered kitchen and shut the door firmly behind him.&lt;br />\u201cHey guys, I\u2019m home.\u201d&lt;br />There was no answer.&lt;br />\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cSam is still partying with some friends after tonight\u2019s battle.\u201d His father, he reflected, must have taken the dog and gone to Holyoke to cruise the bars courting some Spanish girls half his age. \u201cI have the house to myself.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI should probably go online and talk to Tony about the future of Ninja Pirate Inc. And while I\u2019m on I can check out Whippedass.com, my favorite site. Maybe even do a little self-loving . . .\u201d Rich thought grinning.&lt;br />He turned on his computer and while he waited the 10 minutes required for it to boot up, he slipped out of pants, unbuttoned his shirt, and pulled off his socks. He stood before the machine clad only in his boxers.&lt;br />\u201cMaybe I should tend to some of these wounds,\u201d he thought, looking down at the countless cuts, scrapes, burns, and bruises that covered his body, reminders of the night\u2019s battles. There were so many of them, and most of them so grievous, that even with his newly acquired rapid healing it would still take the rest of the night for his body to repair itself. Maybe werewolves heal faster in the heat of battle, with all the endorphins pumping through their systems, he thought. I wonder if Tony feels as bad as I do.&lt;br />He decided upon further contemplation to leave the wounds as they were. I am going to Whippedass.com, he figured. The injuries will make the experience more complete.&lt;br />Richard signed on to AOL and grabbed a handful of tissues. He typed in the address and waited, grinning in anticipation, as the site loaded before him. He had just started to pull down his boxers when the site dissolved and was replaced by the smiling face of the last person he expected to see.&lt;br />\u201cOh my,\u201d chuckled Silas Blake. \u201cI really didn\u2019t know I did it for you.\u201d&lt;br />Rich scrambled to pull up his underwear, stumbling backward in shock.&lt;br />\u201cYou?! How the hell did you . . . ?! What the hell?!&lt;br />\u201cSimple.\u201d Silas explained. \u201cI used cutting-edge bio-electrical technology developed by Umbrella to download a digital version of myself onto a disk. I then sent myself, via AOL, to your computer. Would you believe that the folks at America Online actually helped me to take over your PC? \u2018Anything to further screw a customer of ours,\u2019 they said. As we speak I am slowly encrypting all your files, every square millimeter of circuit board, with myself. I am now a part of your computer.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNo!\u201d Richard yelled. \u201cI won\u2019t let you!\u201d He desperately hit control, alt, delete.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t work. You see, for all indents and porpoises, I am your PC.\u201d&lt;br />Richard grabbed a nearby brass pig and cocked his arm back.&lt;br />\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that!\u201d&lt;br />He was about to smash the monitor in, wiping the pixilated smirk from Blake\u2019s face when a bolt of electricity shot out of the CD drive and struck Richard in the chest. He violently convulsed and fell to the ground.&lt;br />\u201cNaughty, naughty.\u201d Silas wagged a finger back and forth, his smirk broadening, giving his boyish face a slightly mad look. \u201cNo funny stuff or you get another spanking.\u201d He seemed to ponder for a second and then zapped Richard again for emphasis.&lt;br />Richard yelled in pain as the fingers of electricity danced over his body.&lt;br />\u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d he gasped.&lt;br />\u201cOh you liked it!\u201d Blake taunted.&lt;br />\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Richard asked from the floor.&lt;br />\u201cI actually haven\u2019t decided yet. I can\u2019t decide whom to exact my revenge upon first, you and your friends or the Umbrella Corporation. I suppose I\u2019ll stay here, using you and your friends to get at Umbrella, and when that\u2019s finished I\u2019ll kill you one by one.\u201d&lt;br />Richard glared at the screen.&lt;br />\u201cOf course, until then I can always amuse myself by torturing you. For starters, no more online time, meaning your blog is done, as are all IM sessions. I\u2019ll plague you with pop-ups. I\u2019ll break all your burned CD\u2019s. Also, no online time means no more of your favorite pornography sites.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou monster! Not my blog! I need that. My readers depend on me. If I don\u2019t post not only will they be deprived of my awesomeness, but they\u2019ll think I\u2019m just being lazy.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cOh I was just getting started. Next I\u2019ll delete all your files. Slowly. For instance, all your blogs, including any in the works.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cNo!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cThen, how about some choice music files, like that Brendan Smith original?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cAaah!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cAfter those, I\u2019ll delete your pictures, like that sexy one of that girl\u2019s tattoo.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou leave Sarah out of this!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cAh ha. Pictures from The Clearing. Those are gone too.\u201d&lt;br />\u201cEnough!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cEasy, Sparky. Another outburst and I\u2019ll paralyze that yapping little dog of yours. All it takes is a few well place jolts to the ------\u201d&lt;br />He never finished. Richard had been pushed beyond the breaking point. He darted forward, faster than Silas could hit, and pulled the computer\u2019s plug out of the wall.&lt;br />Silas faded gradually from the screen.&lt;br />\u201cI\u2019ll be here waiting when you turn me back on . . .\u201d&lt;br />The screen went black.&lt;br />Richard sat on the floor in front of the computer and clutched the brow despairingly.&lt;br />\u201cWell this is an unsettling development,\u201d he muttered shaking his head.&lt;br />He stared sadly at the ominous black screen.&lt;br />&lt;br />He did not wallow in self-pity for long, however. Once he had considered the wild adventures, near misses, and amazing accomplishes of the night, he felt a surge of relief and a glorious sense of accomplishment. Throwing his clothes back on, slipping on his shoes, and grabbing his car keys he was out the door and on his way to Tony\u2019s in moments.&lt;br />&lt;br />Tony\u2019s house was overrun when Richard got there. The lounge and grounds had been inundated with revelers, joyous heroes drunk on victory and cream soda.&lt;br />He found a quiet corner near the pool table and sat watching the merriment with a feeling of profound satisfaction blended with nebulous concerns for the future.&lt;br />Tony came by and sat next him. For a moment, neither said anything, they merely watched.&lt;br />Andrew, Brendan, Marissa, and Meg were playing pool. Sam was running around singing and eating flour. Dave, EJ, and Jake were laughing conspiratorially over the fuse ball table. Caitlin and Amy were having a relaxed conversation over a bowl of chips. Everywhere they looked happiness and contentment abounded.&lt;br />\u201cI think things are going to get better now,\u201d said Tony, still looking at the party.&lt;br />\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to be concerned with. NP Inc, Blake, Trans,\u201d he paused, \u201cus.\u201d&lt;br />Tony turned to look at his comrade in arms.&lt;br />\u201cLook at them. Look at how happy they are. Do you know what their secret is?\u201d&lt;br />Richard shook his head.&lt;br />Tony went on, \u201cIt\u2019s not that they are oblivious to the problems facing them, it\u2019s simply that they realize they can face those problems when they come to them.\u201d&lt;br />At this point Sam rolled by on the floor, laughing like a madman and throwing darts at the ceiling.&lt;br />\u201cEven Sam?\u201d Rich asked.&lt;br />\u201cEspecially Sam. It\u2019s important release some tension at some point.\u201d&lt;br />Richard was silent for a moment.&lt;br />Then he laughed, slapped Tony on the back, and ran his fingers through his long, curly hair, and got up.&lt;br />\u201cCare for a game of air hockey? And no using vampire speed!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cI could beat you if I were a zombie!\u201d&lt;br />\u201cCare to let some money ride on that?\u201d&lt;br />\u201cYou\u2019re on!\u201d&lt;br />The two friends laughed and joined the revelry, temporarily forgetting their troubles and partying long into the night.&lt;br />&lt;br />The next day was Thanksgiving."},

Maybe not even secretly. Maybe they were all wearing cinnamon-scented \u201cThe Man\u201d Underroos, and I just didn\u2019t get the memo. I was marked, like a terrier\u2019s favorite light-post, and it seemed every bastard I met that day could smell the subterfuge and clueless opposition in my rotten Jockeys.&lt;br />&lt;br />Ultimately, in retrospect, everything turned out for the best. But that day was probably the closest I ever came to taking the NRA up on their standing philosophical proposition and purchasing an automatic weapon. I think I would have tried to rob the police station. \u201cGive me all your justice,\u201d I would have said, \u201cIn small, unmarked ballistic packages.\u201d Self-inflicted suicide is so desperate - and I think there must be a certain level of cool in showing up in Heaven riddled with police slugs. Surely \u201chail of gunfire\u201d deaths get their own wing or something away from the apathetic masses, right next to the \u201cburned up in re-entry\u201d folks.&lt;br />&lt;br />But this story isn\u2019t about my woes, particularly, so let me just give you a quick rundown of where I stood before I get on with the meat and potatoes of this first attempt at chronicling what my life has now become.&lt;br />&lt;br />1) I awaken to the insufferable, psychotic whine of my landlord informing me that I have been evicted for weeks now, and what-the-hell-am-I-still-doing-sleeping-in-His-precious-shithole-of-an-efficiency-apartment. Fair enough. I just can\u2019t quite handle the idea of being homeless yet. It\u2019s like when an amputee\u2019s missing leg begins to itch.&lt;br />&lt;br />2) The library, where I spend most of my days and nights, engaging in what I call \u201cresearch\u201d and what the rest of the world calls \u201cevading responsibility,\u201d informs me that, due to a new municipal policy and budget restrictions, the library will now only be open every other day and close at 5 PM, placing more of an emphasis on circulation, and no longer stooping to babysit society\u2019s dysfunctional, schizotypal cynics. Fuck.&lt;br />&lt;br />3) For some unaccountable reason or another, somebody has checked out everything P.G. Wodehouse ever wrote. Even the book that I was reading and hid in the toilet paper dispenser in the third floor bathroom. I become convinced a conspiracy against me is brewing. Now it will be months before I figure out whether or not the invincible Jeeves has gotten Bertie Wooster out of another unfortunate marriage proposal. I curse out loud, and William T. Crewcut, jabbering into a cell-phone and wearing an orange t-shirt proclaiming allegiance to some sort of prepositional Christ organization, gives me the eye. I hate that.&lt;br />&lt;br />4) An e-mail from Gourmet Skin magazine announces their insolvency, and offers a sad letter of condolence to all its writers who it now cannot pay due to an increasing proliferation of free internet porn and the effective death of the printed pornographic word. It is possible that I am qualified to do something other than write for the cum-rag press, but then again, it is possible that I am not. Best of luck, say the conveniently bankrupt editors of GS. I consider hiring a lawyer, and then I remember that I already owe Satan a favor or two, myself.&lt;br />&lt;br />5) No more 99 cent value menu at Wendy\u2019s.&lt;br />&lt;br />6) As I am walking down Guadalupe, trying to figure out where I stand karmically, and whether or not faking a British accent will increase my chances of getting a small business loan, an exasperated mother and a goggle-eyed, ice-cream clad toddler (my supernatural stain sense tells me it\u2019s vanilla) come bounding out of one of the numerous, forgettable clothing shops that festoon what used to be The Drag. I give the kid my best smile, and with a prestidigitational flourish, remove my thumb to amuse his no-doubt heavily refined sense of the joyfully grotesque. The kid actually begins to cry. His mother grabs his sticky hand, and yanks him in the opposite direction. Man, I love kids...and damned if they don\u2019t 99.9% of the time love me back. Due to our synchronous maturity level, we usually get along great. Therefore, to ease my ego, and because it has been days since I have bathed, I assume I must smell something awful. Leprous-rainy-day-cottage-cheese-feet awful. Still, this particular cosmic brick-in-the-teeth bums me out maybe more than anything else.&lt;br />&lt;br />So there I was - homeless, jobless, hungry, intellectually unsatisfied, without a friend in the world, and feeling utterly, utterly wretched. And then, to top off my proverbial mug of poison Guinness, as I sat in front of the post office, waiting for the mail and (hopefully) answers to my weekly fiction queries, who should chance to come walking by but Her. And She was with Him. The Two of them Together, only Tongues apart, and glowing like the finest Couple ever to walk the fallen, corruptible world.&lt;br />&lt;br />I would like to say I kept my cool. I would like to say I nodded my head slightly, gave them a cool slit-eyed stare, and went back to chatting up the passers by. I would like to say a lot of noble things about myself, but that day was not to be denied the full run of its wrath, and what actually happened fills me now with irreducible shame. I am only human. And when I get angry, I get creative.&lt;br />&lt;br />Let me just say that it was a private moment of ignominy, there was much unpleasantness, and all of us - myself, Her, Him, Johnny Law, that sweet old lady collecting for charity, the United States Postal Service, the Texas State School for the Deaf, and many of the finest words in the Webster\u2019s dictionary - are past that particular point in our lives. I forgive myself, but it was not pretty. After collecting my pants and proving to the beat cop that I was not in fact on PCP, I was sent on my way with a warning, having not technically done anything illegal. Not technically, not in Austin. The cop took pity on me, I now realize. She, however, never looked back.&lt;br />&lt;br />And that was when Fate would decide that I had suffered enough. That was when a dark wind would blow the weathervane-thin indicator of my attention in an entirely new direction. That was when I saw the flyer that would lead me to Jack Acid.&lt;br />&lt;br />It caught my eye out of nowhere, pasted sideways across one of those public forum posts between a band poster (\u201cBloody Stool\u201d opening for \u201cAbraded Elbow Lesion\u201d) and an open proclamation to the world that Socialism is the answer to all manifest problems. The flyer must have been a month old. I couldn\u2019t read the bottom half, as it was obscured by a pathetic looking picture of a lost dachshund, but the top half was enough to hijack my self-pity and get me curious. I looked to see if anyone else was watching, and then snapped it off with a quick flick of my wrist to get a better look. It was pretty grimy. In faded gold-leaf lettering on a baby-blue background were the words: ROOMMATE NEEDED. FREE RENT. NO CATCH. NO SHIT. I AM LOOKING FOR ONE IN A MILLION - I AM LOOKING FOR A MIRACLE.&lt;br />&lt;br />There were slots for toothy little tags on which one would ordinarily find a phone number, but no tags left.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cToo bad,\u201d I said to myself, looking for a trash can to toss it into. \u201cThis almost looks legit.\u201d It couldn\u2019t have been advertising. There was no hook.&lt;br />&lt;br />I began to get the unmistakable prickly feeling of being watched. I spun around in the air, expecting a pickpocket. I was wrong. Standing there, staring at me, and then laughing at me, was a sight for the sorest eyes this side of an Antarctic snow storm.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cZeke!\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cMr. Jones, I presume.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />A seven-foot tall, bespectacled man wearing a T-shirt that says \u201cGod used to be my co-pilot, but then we crashed in the mountains of Nepal and I was forced to eat him\u201d can\u2019t help but make you smile. Plus, Ezekiel Sandoz and I grew up together. We met in fifth grade when I kicked the everloving crap out of Elliot Michaels one day in computer lab for making fun of him past all reason. He just wouldn\u2019t shut up about Zeke being a character on the Oregon Trail \u2013 \u201cYou got snakebit, Zeke\u201d \u201cZeke, you died of a broken leg\u201d - and it had really started to annoy me. It eventually came to a head, I had to fight him, and even though I got my nose broken and lost the respect of almost every girl in the neighborhood who thought I was a sweet elementary school innocent, I won a friend for life.&lt;br />&lt;br />We got along great back then, and we still do. Zeke has an incredibly religious, slightly insane family and I don\u2019t have one to speak of at all, so we compromised. I occasionally got a Christmas, and he occasionally got drugs and laid. Eventually, Zeke hit a late puberty, where he rocketed up from the ground like some sort of experimental genetically-modified oak, and I still reap the benefits of intimidating protection from time to time. Inside both of our minds, though, he is still shorter than I am.&lt;br />&lt;br />The last time I had seen him was at his graduation. He was now working on his PhD in Philosophy, and didn\u2019t have as much time for kicks and hijinks.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cHomeless again, Jones?\u201d said Zeke.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cYou know it. Hey, you remember that time we went around and tried to painstakingly turn every speed-limit sign in Austin that had a 3 on it into an 8? I was just thinking about that the other day. We got greedy. We should have just made 2s into 3s. Nobody would even have noticed.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cYeah, but where would be the radically empty symbolic gesture there?\u201d said Zeke, grinning.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cIt\u2019s a fine line, to be sure,\u201d I said.&lt;br />&lt;br />Zeke picked me up in a bone crushing bear-hug, and then set me back down, where I could recuperate and pop back together my telescoped joints. Sucker-punch style, he snatched the flier out of my hand as I stretched, examined it like it was a rat turd in a jar of peanut butter, and then began to fumble around in his disproportionately tiny wallet with his huge, rough hands. He looked like the most gigantic little old lady ever. I think I even heard him cluck his tongue.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cHmmm...yes...I know it\u2019s in here somewhere. I have a present for you, you runty little white man. As I approached, I saw you staring at that roommate-wanted sign there like it was a 6-month Papal indulgence, and it occurred to me that I have the missing piece of your puzzle. I found it glommed onto the bottom of my shoe the other day, and I kept it because it seemed so odd. I thought it might come in handy. This is what you might call an outstanding, improbable coincidence.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cYou know me, Zeke. \u2018Improbable Coincidence\u2019 is stenciled on the underside of each of my eyelids.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />He grunted in satisfaction and amazingly pulled out one of the flier\u2019s mislaid tag incisors. It was the same unusual shade of blue, and had the same gold-leaf writing. I tried to match it up with the tear-marks, and found that it had come from the very last slot on the left. Bafflingly, it read: YOUR PHONE NUMBER IS 555 - 0121. GET READY TO BE SHOCKED.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not my phone number,\u201d said Zeke. \u201cI thought it was just a reject from the shittiest fortune cookie company ever.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />The payphone behind us began to ring. Zeke and I looked at each other. A ringing unattended payphone is spy movie fodder. My brain began to tingle. I leaned over to check, and sure enough, the payphone\u2019s number was 555 - 0121. Perhaps things were looking up.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cBetter answer it,\u201d said Zeke. \u201cI\u2019m late for class, and if I remember correctly, the last time I got involved in one of your irresponsible forays into the outer darkness, we both got arrested. I think I still have community service hours to do. Let me know how it all works out.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />He took off, leaving me to my enlightenment. I watched him leave - slightly frustrated. I kind of wanted him to buy me lunch. But he knew my weakness.&lt;br />&lt;br />I picked up the handset.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cHello? If this is James Bond, let me just say I think you are a lackluster authoritarian toad.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cYou must be my miracle,\u201d said the voice at the other end. It was smooth, and sedate. Clipped, yet almost catatonically calm. I started to respond, but I was cut off. \u201cIn polite society, my name is Jonathan Acid. But my friends call me Jack. As in Kennedy, or Ing Off. Since we are now formally introduced, I need you to first do a favor for me, and then we will discuss my needs and how we are going to decorate.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cHold on,\u201d I said, \u201cJust to get things straight. This is about the free room, right? What\u2019s with the elaborately cryptic escapade here? Am I bugged?\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cDon\u2019t bother thinking about how this is all happening right now. I\u2019ll explain later, when time is not so pressing a concern. What I need you to do presently, is to go as fast as you can to the corner of 29th and Guadalupe, behind the vendors and fronts. There you will find a gigantic, peach-colored dumpster, locked and latched. You will also find a bolt cutter underneath a big bag of Crunchee-Tatums Ketchup Flavored Potato Crisps. Cut those locks, pocket them, and get inside the dumpster. Sit quietly, stay attentive, and I will be along shortly to fill you in further. I know this is odd, but if you can\u2019t handle it, let me know now. It\u2019s a good sign that you haven\u2019t hung up so far, but most people can\u2019t stomach this much of a deviation from consensus, normative situations. You will be breaking the law, and I need to know the level of complicity with which you are comfortable. You picked a good day, my friend...this may be our last chance.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />What did I have to lose? I started to say something witty, like \u201cBuddy, I think you may just be the answer to every one of my fictional prayers,\u201d or \u201cI was born illegitimate, and I\u2019ve been trying to top it ever since,\u201d but instead I just said, \u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d and hung up. This was cool as a porno popsicle, and I could play all day.&lt;br />&lt;br />I turned up my collar and sleazed my way to the given location as fast as I could. I got a lot of blank stares. Sometimes I like to pretend I am in a zombie movie and people are very slowly trying to eat my brains. Based on the way I feel every morning when the sun hits my eyeballs, I think they may just get a chunk or two while I am asleep. Today, however, I moved through the streets like a svelte, high-octane, feline slinking machine, and I was even fairly certain I wasn\u2019t being followed.&lt;br />&lt;br />The dumpster was right where Jack had said it would be. This was, I must say, a classy dumpster. It was more like a trash utility shed. It had four walls, was big enough to fit a van inside, and even seemed to be insulated. I could understand why it had locks on it - any self-respecting member of the vagrant persuasion would be more than happy to hole up here and perform their various drug related rituals free from the inclement elements and the prying eyes of justice.&lt;br />&lt;br />I looked for the bag of ketchup chips, found it, removed the bolt cutters, and pocketed them. I circled the shed to make sure there was no one hiding behind it, or that none of the employees of the surrounding shops and restaurants were taking advantage of its concealing size to cadge a quick smoke or a grope. Satisfied, I whipped out the cutters, and snipped off the locks. I picked them up from where they fell clanking to the concrete and stowed them in my jeans.&lt;br />&lt;br />The dumpster was almost empty. There was a single Hefty sack in one of the corners, and a soggy pile of old newspapers. I thought it would be dark and I would have insects and rats to contend with, but instead light poured through a huge hole in the ceiling, a result of what looked to be some sort of chemical corrosion. The edges of the hole were sharp and irregular, and looked chewed.&lt;br />&lt;br />I sat down on the stack of newspapers and began once more to examine the mystery flier and its corresponding tag.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the direct sunlight, I noticed something strange. Attached to the top of the flier by a piece of clear tape was an almost invisible, razor-thin strand of anomalous fiber. When I had grabbed the flier so hastily, I must have snapped it off of whatever it was attached to, because I could tell by the ragged end that it had led somewhere. Curiouser and curiouser.&lt;br />&lt;br />A knock at the door interrupted my inspections and cogitations. I wasn\u2019t sure whether to answer it or not. Before I could make up my mind, my problem was solved for me. In walked the man who could only be Jack Acid. Only this person could match the name and that laconic, hypnotic, narcotic of a voice.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cHello, hello,\u201d said Jack. He was roughly my age and height, and we shared the same build, but the similarities stopped there. He was dressed in a bright pink, almost fluorescent, three-piece suit. In lieu of a necktie, he wore a slender piece of mirror around his neck that gave the appearance of a tie quite convincingly until you looked at it twice and saw yourself looking back. His features were fine and thin, childlike without being pretty or dainty. His hair was shoulder length - dyed blue - and he looked as if he hadn\u2019t shaved in a week or so. He took lanky to a new extreme, but the way he moved, it was as if he was poured like olive oil into the space he would occupy in each subsequent passing moment. The closest analogue I can come up with is that he moved the way professionals - real professionals - have sex. He had grace. I liked him.&lt;br />&lt;br />I offered my hand to shake. He put a sandwich into it.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cI got you some calories. Eat, and I\u2019ll explain. We don\u2019t have much time, but there is a minimum amount of information that must be conveyed to you to keep your head above water.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />He shut the door behind him. I began to eat. Can you blame me? I suppose it could have been poisoned, but as I said, I liked the guy.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cAlright...I\u2019ll keep it simple, citizen,\u201d said Jack. \u201cThis is our new digs. Not this particular dumpster precisely, but at least the same model. We are going to get a new one, untainted by the soiled remains of civilized waste. Brass tacks: we are about to engage in a felony of epic ...well semi-epic, anyway... proportions. Criminal Mischief 6703: Theft of a Municipal Trash Receptacle. But don\u2019t feel too bad about it. As you can see...\u201d He pointed with his pinky to the hole in the ceiling. \u201cThis particular trash receptacle is no longer functional, and is therefore slated for removal, post-haste. Do you know what they do with dumpsters when they no longer work, my friend?\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cNo. What?\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cThey throw them away. And we are merely going to benefit, parasitically, from their absurd insistence on cosmetic virtue.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cHow convenient.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cNot really...the hole was my doing. Easy as squirtable cheese. Now, pay attention! In approximately...\u201d he pulled back his sleeve and revealed a Felix-the-Cat wristwatch. The eyes even moved. I suppressed a giggle. \u201c...seven minutes, the two gentlemen charged with removing and replacing this particular trash receptacle will be arriving. Follow my lead. I don\u2019t have much of a plan, because I like to stay open to the flexibility of improvisation, but the ultimate goal is to catch them by surprise, render them insensible, and abscond with their delivery. These two fellows are not the brightest neon in the beer sign, but they do have size on us, so it may be tricky. Especially since, due to certain moral decalogues to which I must adhere, I will not be able to do anything violent.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cJust pretend I\u2019m your grandmother,\u201d he said.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cThey say my Nana was a teamster.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cYeah, well. I just can\u2019t. There\u2019s no time to get into it.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cFair enough. The name\u2019s Jones, by the way.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cFirst or last?\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />I shrugged.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cBoring. I shall, of course, call you Miracle. It\u2019s only natural. That is what I requested, and that is what you have become. So what do you do Miracle?\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cI write. Oh yeah, and sometimes I agitate for social justice. Hey, listen won\u2019t they come looking for our stolen little hideaway when they realize it\u2019s been snatched?\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cCertainly not. They will be much too embarrassed. They\u2019ll simply bring another one. The city has a trash budget that could take care of the homeless problem tomorrow. We will park our new home somewhere out of the loop, and defend it with wits and class.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />I finished my sandwich, impressed. Something was still bothering me, though.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cSo how\u2019d you know you\u2019d find somebody to help you today? Seems a bit reckless. And what makes you think I would be into living in a dumpster with you, buddy?\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be? And it wasn\u2019t really that reckless, actually. I\u2019ve been changing the locks on this dumpster every day for weeks now. When that doesn\u2019t work, I slash tires...falsify documents...make prank phone calls. Anything to stall until I found the right muscle. Being a monkeywrench to the bureaucracy machine is like being a window washer at NORAD. Easy. If you truly hate the system as much as I do, you\u2019re in luck, because it\u2019s just so mindless to manipulate. They keep showing up and going back to the station, and they get paid either way. And to answer your second question further, you are the only one who has responded with anything like enthusiasm to my little interview. The flier you took was connected to a small radio transmitter hidden inside the hollow poster pylon that alerted me whenever the flier was jostled by the violence of someone, say, pulling off one of the tags. You evidently pulled off the whole damn flier. Look, when I said I needed a roommate, I was holding back a bit. What I really need is actually something much more difficult to find. And I always trust in coincidence and synchronicity to do my dirty work. What I really need is...\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />Without warning, the door opened up, catching us off guard. The garbagemen were early. While talking, we hadn\u2019t heard them creep up on us. Two bowlegged men in matching brown jumpsuits stood there with wide ovals of shock on their pusses, staring at me and my sandwich, and Jack and his suit. However, when they regained their composure, they were majorly...nay, royally...pissed off. I got the impression they had been waiting to find out who had been messing with their schedule for weeks now, and were very excited about turning that person into something prone and twitching. However, it had been a world-record bad day for me, and they had interrupted my new friend in the middle of what could potentially be some sort of startling revelation. Did I mention I\u2019m just a bit psychotic? With a right cross, and then a follow-up blow to the stomach to get him low enough for an uppercut (which I delivered with utter grace), I felled the first one, and then used his body to knock the other one down. I gave the second guy a pulled kick to the head, and he joined his chum in the magic land of dreams and swirls. No big thing. Zeke would have scoffed: they were certainly no Elliot Michaels.&lt;br />&lt;br />Immediately, Jack bent down and checked their pulses.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cExcellent. Good discipline. Their injuries will be minor.\u201d After inspecting them, Jack looked a little green.&lt;br />&lt;br />I grabbed their truck keys. \u201cAlright, Mr. Jack Acid. I\u2019ll help you steal this dumpster. But as far as being your new roommate, we\u2019ll have to see. I, too, like to stay open to the flexibility of improvisation.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />Jack smiled for the first time. \u201cWe won\u2019t be stealing their truck for good,\u201d said Jack, \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want to get the police involved, so we must bring it right back here as soon as we take this dumpster to where we need it. I have the perfect place in mind. Let\u2019s really hurry, though, before they awaken.\u201d&lt;br />&lt;br />I put my foot on the truck\u2019s sideboard, ready to climb up. Jack had stopped, and was looking at me with new eyes. I noticed for the first time that he had my copy of Wodehouse\u2019s Right Ho, Jeeves tucked under his arm. I was not surprised.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u201cMiracle, I was going to say, what I really need is a partner.\u201d"},

We had a great Christmas gathering with all the usual suspects in attendance.  Two days later, Vanessa's family gathered at V's parents' and we had &lt;span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Christmas Dinner part II (The Revenge of the Cranberries)&lt;/span>. It was a nice get-together, and I really do think that I'm going to fit into the family quite comfortably.&lt;br />&lt;br />Oh yeah, I'm getting married in four months.  Less than.  May 2.  I guess we'd better get that guest list finalised.  I'm constantly torn with who I can invite because, unfortunately, the hall where we're having the reception (my church) isn't overly large, and we're limited to 180 or so people... which really isn't very many when you take into account the large size of both our families, and our copious amount of friends.  Do any etiquette experts have any thoughts on how to gracefully approach this? perhaps posting this thought on my blog is a bad / good idea...?  I'm in a bind, either way... the church where we're having the wedding would probably hold everyone we'd like to invite, but the reception hall is just too small.  Blah.  And no, changing the reception hall location is not an option...&lt;br />&lt;br />Today on my way home from school i was considering the irony of having ads for car dealerships on the side of public transit buses...  advertising on the competition.  Genius.&lt;br />&lt;br />I was thinking about the railway today as well.  In Canada there's a strong affection for the railway because it was this \"iron ribbon\" that brought Canada together in Confederation... it's what made it possible.  When someone rides VIA Rail these days the trains are (not irregularly) delayed by freight trains passing especially if the passenger train was behind schedule.  Apparently passenger trains are a second priority on the rails.  So anyways, this thought ran through my mind and suddenly it clicked that the rail line that is so revered in Canadian history wasn't built to move people across the continent as I'd often assumed... it was built to move goods. Trees.  Ores.  Coal. How disillusioning to think that this symbol of Canadiana is simply a tool for business...  maybe I'm just naive, but that realisation disappoints me greatly.&lt;br />&lt;br />Sorry for the randomness... just had to get those thoughts out!"},

I was backing out of my Wal-Mart parking spot and I had put my car in drive and was about to pull forward when I see this guy back out his parking spot and run straight into my back door on the passenger side. lol. It's only a little dent, but now he has to pay $961.69.&lt;br />&lt;br />My life is so adventurous.&lt;br />&lt;br />I am going to buy a new car. New as in, only one guy has owned this car and he's elderly and now I am going to buy it from him. lol. I was thinking about getting a new car before I got hit, but now it's definite.&lt;br />&lt;br />I am fine, by the way. No injuries. Although, I DID have a headache for 2 days after the wreck...heh.&lt;br />&lt;br />Anyway, I think I spent almost $100 on V-Day this year for everybody. That's b/c I bought stuff for about 26 ppl that I work with and then some things for family and friends. Oh, well.&lt;br />&lt;br />I had a dream two night ago that I died while saving my sister's 4 year old daughter, named Em. I don't know what that is short for. She had been playing with her red ball and it had fallen in a hole in the street and she fell in while trying to get it out. I ran over and before anybody could stop I jumped into the hole. It reminded me of a worker's hole. It had platforms and wires and stuff hanging everywhere and I could smell gas. I looked up and saw my sister leaning over the hole looking down at me. She was yelling for Em and me. I said I was alright and then I heard a muffled cry. I looked over and I could see Em sitting on one of the platforms. She was crying and holding her red ball. I said\"Come here, Em. Come to Aunt Jessie.\" and she crawled over to me. I wrapped her in my arms and climbed as far up to my sister as I could and then lifted her up. My sister grabbed her and pulled her to safety just as the hole I was in exploded.......Yea, I woke up then. I was sweating and I felt like I couldn't breathe. I remember thinking that Em was very pretty. She had blonde hair instead of red like Levi's. But she was pretty nonetheless.&lt;br />&lt;br />Anyway, the next night I had a dream that I was pregnant, and the father was either Robby or Drew. They are brothers with whom I work with. It was really weird because they kept asking which was the father and I had no idea. I didn't remember being with either or them. It was really weird.&lt;br />&lt;br />Then the night after that one I had a dream where I was at Wal-Mart and for some reason there was a pile of snakes in the floor. They weren't going anywhere, just staying in that pile hissing and striking . Somebody said that I had to put them in a bag (a Wal-Mart bag) and get rid of them. I hate snakes, btw. Anyway, I was crying like crazy b/c I didn't want to be near them. I was really scared. They made me grab a bag that had a snake in it and it kept poking its head above the bag and trying to strike me hands that were holding the handles. Anyway, I kept saying I don't want to. but they said they would fire me and I was like idc, fire me but I'm not messing with the snakes. I was crying the entire time. I was crying really hard and I felt like&lt;em> &lt;/em>I couldn't breathe b/c I was so scared of the snakes. Anyway, I woke myself up crying. I cry for a few more minutes after I woke up.&lt;br />&lt;br />Well, those are my dreams for the past few days. I don't know if I am really stressed or depressed or something, but don't really know it so it comes out in my dreams. I don't know, but they were all weird.&lt;br />&lt;br />I guess I am going to go now. I have letter to write...:: grins::&lt;br />&lt;br />Later.&lt;br />&lt;br />P.S. You can write me, too. It doesn't have to go in order. I write. You write. I write. You write. Break the mold.&lt;/span>&lt;/strong>"},

Various schools clubs &amp; Assemblies and now, finally, half term. It only seems like a few weeks since Christmas, and I guess, really, it is. But I have a week to get on with admin and prep for the new youth service \"Express\".&lt;br />&lt;br />It's all very exciting. I just organised for a member of the church to head up the all important \"Cake Ministry Team\" and everything else is going just fine. Also this week should give me a chance to finish off the all new church website, and finally do the chimney breast in our lounge, but who knows? Watch this space.&lt;br />&lt;br />Lent is such a wierd time. You give up stuff for God, but only if it's really bad for you anyway. I thought the idea of lent was to give up stuff that actually did you no harm, so that it was purely about putting God first. Maybe I have a warped view on this issue. Let me know your views.&lt;br />&lt;br />Saying that... I actually didn't give up anything for lent. My contribution is a set of 40 scripture verse \"flash cards\" on my study desk. One for each day (suprisingly) but even they are still set to day number one. Never mind. I just have some catching up to do.&lt;br />&lt;br />I'm actually really frustrated tonight.&lt;br />&lt;br />Ross &amp; I decided that after me beating him several times at FIFA on the PS2 that we should be completely daft and get a cheap trophy to swap bewteen houses depending on who is reigning FIFA champ. (sounds sad eh?) and tonight, for the first time so far, Ross won and took the trophy home. My heart was broken (well, not maybe that severe). I MUST regain the title, for my own sanity's sake.&lt;br />&lt;br />I really don't know if anyone reads this blog ever. But at least it gives me a chance to vent my frustrations and get things of my chest.&lt;br />&lt;br />And finally...&lt;br />&lt;br />Believe it or not, yesterday Lara &amp; I went to starbucks, but that's not the amazing bit. On the way there. Lara starts singing this song and then says, \"It's really wierd, I can't think where I've heard that song, but I can't get it out of my head.\" Sounds like a fairly normal thing to say huh? Well, it would be, but it was a song that (wait for it)... I WROTE!! nearly 2 years ago and haven't ever really sung it since. I Cannot believe that Lara had no idea she was singing one of my songs. How odd. It's also inspired me to finally write the second verse that I never got round to.&lt;br />&lt;br />Right, That's it. So long, and thanks for all the fish!"},
