But humor me as I pretend.) know that I am &lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;\">not&lt;/span> a creative cook. I am a scientist, and can (sometimes) follow instructions very well. So I have invested in some good cookbooks and spend a lot of time scouring recipes on the internet. I will share with you which recipes I thought came out well and which did not. And I will tell you where they came from. Because I can almost guarantee that they were not creations of mine!&lt;br />&lt;br />Dinner on Saturday night was motivated by a few things. First, we receive our weekly produce box on Thursdays from Moore Farms and Friends. Because the produce tends to be quite diverse and often new to me, I try explore recipes and cook some of it up over the weekend. This week, among other things, we had a bunch of Komastuna and 2 pounds of mixed roots (including PURPLE potatoes\u2026 who knew!). Second, we had dinner at Soto Soto on Friday night. The food was absolutely excellent. The sort of food that reminds me why I love food so much. (Thanks to the husband\u2019s boss for taking us there for the annual holiday party!) Perhaps someone who is better with words can help me to explain the experience of taking a bite of simple, yet perfectly flavored, beautifully fragrant food. You just close your eyes, take a small bite and sit back and enjoy. Anyway, the cuisine was Italian, and the husband had some fabulously done polenta along side his duck. (Of course it quacks). Note: Since this is technically the husband\u2019s blog too, I think \"the husband\" is too impersonal. I will call him J from now on.&lt;br />&lt;br />This random assortment of motivations led to a dinner of roasted roots, saut\u00e9ed Komastuna, and baked polenta. An odd mix, but the range of colors speaks to how nutrient-dense the meal must have been.&lt;br />&lt;br />I didn\u2019t take a picture this time, but check out the weekly newsletter from &lt;a href=\"http://67.199.18.136/store/pc/viewContent.asp?idpage=92\">Moore Farms and Friends&lt;/a> for the roasted roots. &lt;br />We used their recipe (toss the diced roots in olive oil with salt and pepper) plus a few additions. We added a handful of shallots (whole), some sprigs of rosemary from the remains of our garden and a bit of thyme. &lt;br />&lt;br />Once the roots were cooking, I realized I hadn\u2019t started the polenta and had no clue how the timing of the meal was going to work out. There\u2019s usually one point during each meal that I become totally overwhelmed with the mess I\u2019ve made (I'll have to post pictures one day - I make a serious mess while cooking), the pile of dirty dishes, and the three things that inevitably need to be stirred, tasted and turned at the same time. Often that\u2019s when J will come to the rescue. So J helped get things prepped while I tried to figure out how to cook the polenta.&lt;br />&lt;br />We\u2019ve tried making polenta once before \u2013 we cooked it for the full 30 minutes on the stove (stirring, stirring, stirring\u2026 keep that husband stirring) and ended up with a thick, coagulated, not-so-tasty block. But at Soto Soto, J\u2019s polenta was almost creamy on the inside and nice and crunchy on the outside. My brief internet search turned up many polenta recipes, but none were described as such. So we cooked it according to the recipe on the package (6 cups water, 2 cups polenta, some salt), for somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes, stirring continuously. When it had the consistency of thick cereal with no visible liquid, but was still far from paste, we poured it into a pyrex baking dish and let it sit for a few minutes. I brushed the top with melted butter and stuck it in the oven with the roots. At about 10 minutes the roots were done so I dropped the oven temperature to 350, added the shredded parmesan that I had forgotten about earlier in the process, and cooked for another 10 minutes. At 20 minutes it wasn\u2019t quite crunchy enough, so I stuck it under the broiler for 2 minutes. The cheese bubbled up nicely and left a slightly browned, crisp top.&lt;br />&lt;br />Meanwhile\u2026 the saut\u00e9ed Komatsuna. We had prepared it in the past saut\u00e9ed on its own, as well as served with Asian Turnip Greens. This time we wanted to try something different. &lt;br />&lt;a href=\"http://chubbybunnyrecipes.blogspot.com/2007/06/sauted-komatsuna-with-basil.html\">The recipe &lt;/a>adds a considerable amount basil at the end of the cooking process and sounded intriguing. Sadly, this was one of the times where I sort of forgot to follow the instructions. The greens were supposed to be steamed for a few minutes, not continuously saut\u00e9ed. Whoops. And when I added the basil it turned black. I know that cutting into wet basil causes it to turn, but these were fresh, intact basil leaves. Perhaps the heat was too high (not off like it was supposed to be according to the recipe) and it caused the cellular structure to break down? This is a question for AB! Either way, I doubt we\u2019ll be trying this recipe again.&lt;br />&lt;br />The verdict:&lt;br />The roasted roots were both attractive and tasty. J loved the strong horseradish-like aromas and tastes from some of the roots. These were a success. And believe it or not, the polenta turned out really well, and without all of the hard work I was expecting. We\u2019ll definitely be using that \u201crecipe\u201d again.  I will also  be eating it for the rest of the week because there were tons of leftovers. As for the Komastuna, I learned (as I often do) that simplicity is good. And follow instructions."},

You don't need to be a genius to work out why that is. Most gamers are men. Most men enjoy looking at buxom, pouty, scantily clad women. You'd be hard pressed to find a woman character in a videogame who doesn't flaunt her sexuality to some degree. It's all a matter of degrees though. Some games can maintain a modicum of subtlety and class in this regard, even going so far as properly contextualising the character's behaviour and motivation within the plot (such as &lt;strong>Silent Hill 2&lt;/strong>'s Maria, or &lt;strong>Metal Gear Solid 3&lt;/strong>'s Eva).&lt;br />&lt;br />On the other hand, there are games that seek to do none of this, offering shameless titillation without concern for plot, or even decent gameplay. In Japan, this kind of game is a genre unto itself. Japanese budget game publisher D3 has released a whole slew of games centred around women in bikinis doing stuff. Fighting, snowboarding, posing, playing mahjong, dismembering zombies, competing in wacky game-shows, growing to enormous size and crushing cities godzilla-style, etc. It's an established and accepted genre in Japan.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the Western world, games like these have never really taken off. The notable exception is Tecmo's &lt;strong>Dead or Alive: Xtreme Beach Volleyball&lt;/strong> (XBox) which was less of a volleyball game, and more of a boob-simulator. Tecmo's DOA fighting-game franchise was always better known for its cast of busty women and jiggle-dynamics than its core gameplay. Cashing in on this, Tecmo saw fit to release a game focussed on the girls of DOA bouncing around in swimsuits. It sold massive numbers all over the world, not because its target-market wanted to play volleyball, but because they wanted to see these virtual girls jiggling about in increasingly skimpy bikinis. Ironically, DOA:XBV is, in my opinion, one of the 'girliest' games ever made. Behind the eye-candy, the game is really all about shopping for outfits and accessorizing.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://game.goo.ne.jp/contents/news/NGN20040601exp01/20040601_01_01.jpg\" />&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://www.gamerankings.com/screens5/919556/5.jpg\" />&lt;br />&lt;br />All this pre-amble brings me to the latest wrestling game from Konami. \"The first and only all-women's wrestling game on any platform\": &lt;strong>Rumble Roses&lt;/strong> (PS2). Konami, the very same company that gave the world the Silent Hill and Metal Gear games, has shockingly released the new pinnacle in boob-powered videogames. Make no mistake - Rumble Roses hits the player over the head with overt T &amp; A like no other game I've ever seen. It's all presented in a fairly light-hearted manner with no nudity whatsoever, and yet it seems more confronting than ever due to the lifelike animation. The fact is that in games that bother to animate breasts, they're typically more reminiscent of large globes of weightless jelly than any real body parts. Not so in Rumble Roses - its evident that a lot of time was spent perfecting the physics and motion of the Roses' bodies, such that they move, bounce and, dare I say it, sag in a very weighty and realistic fashion. And then there are the mud matches - that's right: women in bikins wrestling in mud. Another dubious first for videogames.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://www.gamerankings.com/screens5/919556/31.jpg\" />&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://www.gamerankings.com/screens5/919556/20.jpg\" />&lt;br />&lt;br />I asked myself how Konami could stoop so low as to produce one of these tacky pervert games that sacrifices gameplay and production values for the sake of cheap smut. &lt;em>Well, hang on a minute.&lt;/em> It may look like a duck, but it doesn't necessarily quack like a duck. Konami developed this game in conjunction with Yukes, the undisputed masters of wrestling game design. Despite my view that (and I may be struck down for saying this) wrestling games don't rank too highly up the foodchain, I have to admit the gameplay mechanics of Rumble Roses are solid. It's slightly less complex than Yukes' Smackdown games but is just as well balanced and no doubt was simplified to make it more accessible and fun. Performing the usual wrestling moves fills meters, alowing each character to execute special killer, lethal and humiliation moves. Some of these are truly spectacular. The production values are actually very high; the graphics engine is impressive and the wrestling animation and motion capture work is top notch. There &lt;strong>is&lt;/strong> actually a plot. A ridiculous one, to be sure, involving the use of a legendary dead wrestler's DNA in an evil scheme to produce cyborgs, but its better than nothing. Each character has a storyline, played out in cutscenes between matches. Each character also has an unlockable alter-ego, which is more than just a mere palette-swap or alternate costume. The alter-egos have their own distinct personalities and storylines. The voice acting is dire, but the soundtrack is very good, from the rocking cover of David Lee Roth's Yankee Rose, to new tracks from Konami's respected composer Akira Yamaoka. This game has Konami written all over it, from the character design, to the music and the billboards throughout the game promoting other Konami franchises.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://www.gamerankings.com/screens5/919556/6.jpg\" />&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://www.gamerankings.com/screens5/919556/38.jpg\" />&lt;br />&lt;br />Konami are not ashamed. Perhaps they shouldn't be. While they have produced an outrageously blatent T &amp;amp; A game, they have also made the first game of this type that actually plays well and is technically a quality production in almost every respect (attrocious voice acting aside).&lt;br />&lt;br />Is it a great game? Certainly not.&lt;br />Is it a good game? Yes, strangely enough it is.&lt;br />Will it succeed? It has the potential to sell bucketloads.&lt;br />Will it help change the popular perception of gamers as sexually frustrated geeks who need to get out more? No.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;em>Rumble Roses will be released in Australia this Friday.&lt;/em>"},

I think enough time has passed for me to be able to say this with certainty: this semester SUCKS! I was hoping that with time it would get better, but a month has passed. It's still boring. My schedule is unbelievably boring. Basically, I just sit in the back of classrooms and play games on my iPod or read, and I HAVE to go to class because of the strict attendance policy at the school. So I get my entertainment pack together, much like I do when I'm getting ready to go to church, so the hours of boredom will pass without incident.&lt;br />&lt;br />The thing that really sucks about the boring schedule is that it has caused me to be apathetic regarding how well I do in these classes. Like, this morning, I had a test, and I didn't even study for it. The material was so boring that my choices were to die from boredom or to not make an A on the test. I chose to not make an A, so I took the most boring test in the world this morning, actually finished it, and scored 80%. And I'm happy with that. I got a B on my chemistry test 2 weeks ago, and I'm happy with that.&lt;br />&lt;br />Another strange consequence of having a boring schedule is that my favorite class is chemistry lab, taught by &lt;a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=6000551\">my male arch-nemesis of 2005&lt;/a>. I know...shocker! He's actually being very nice this semester. I mean, he still rips people's heads off and shoves them down their throat if they come in late to class, but in lab, he's cordial. He doesn't make me feel stupid when I mess things up. When I ask questions in class, he's more than eager to answer them. He's the exact opposite of what he was last semester, unless you're late for class. Don't even try that. Just don't. I've seen him make grown men cry. Anyway, I was like the star of the class last night. And he said I was \"charming him\" because asking questions meant that I had read the lecture before going to class. I'm not really out to charm that man, but I'm open to any methods of not succumbing to the desire to cry in front of him."},

We tried the Blue Elephant Restaurant then...there were a lot of groans of dismay from folks as most people did not seem to enjoy Thai food. I love spicy food so I had no complaints.&lt;br />&lt;br />As I strolled through the restaurant it became obvious that much time and money has been poured into creating the exotic ambiance, which seems to cleverly cater just as much for romantic couples as it does for large upmarket office crowds.&lt;br />&lt;br />I had a cocktail called - Miss Siam which iis basically Coconut flesh, Coconut water, Skyy vanilla, Passion fruit liqueur. It was good.&lt;br />&lt;br />Having studied the extensive menu for ten minutes and still not chosen, the group decided to opt for the Royal Thai Banquet with soup (\u00a339 per person), washed down by a reasonably priced bottle of Pinot Blanc and Merlot. And we were not disappointed by our choice. Starters included the regular mixture of Paper Prawns, Fish Cakes, Dim Sum, Satay and Spring rolls followed by a beautifully spicy Tom Yum soup. However, I would have liked slightly more time to digest the starters so that I could fully appreciate the six main courses; this banquet really is not for those with a small appetite! The Emerald Chicken and Green Curry really stood out for me, as well as the Ped Makaram, tender duck slices with a tamarind sauce. The Fresh Black Pepper Tiger Prawn were tender and delicious but the lamb Massaman was strictly OK.By the time the desserts arrived, I was filled to the brim! However I felt I had had a truly wonderful dining experience, and look forward to my next trip to the Blue Elephant. I know my travel companions from the U.S would beg to differ ;)"},

Quite a bit has changed in the last 5 months, that's for goddamn sure.&lt;br />&lt;br />Well, I've been at work officially for over a year now, and I'm still not insane! While Christmas time was fairly hectic, it certainly was survivable, although unpleasant. I suppose the only thing I learned from it is just how goddamn dumb Christmas really is. There were days where I'd accumulate $6000 in my register alone. That's almost a thousand dollars an hour from customers who shouldn't be spending that much and who I doubt have the money anyway. Thanks to the advent of credit cards, it's never been easier to spend money that you don't have! I mean shit, take that $500 of clothes and instead of feeling happy that you spent your money, give it to a family who would be happy to have it in the first place.&lt;br />&lt;br />money-spending+items doesn't equal happiness. Pretty simple really.&lt;br />&lt;br />Anyway, while I used to hate pretty much everyone at work, I'm on good terms with each and every one of them. This Christmas took out the two main targets for some reason, and as such, work is actually pretty cool now. Aside from the puny amount of shifts I've been getting lately, but that's a symptom of the moarket and not the atmosphere. At least I hope."},

I started second this time then had an awful start. Further in the back, though, two karts locked wheels, and on went flying. It was the number 66 of Kyle Fittro. His kart started to do back flips through the air after he fell out from the initial contact. He had a scraped wrist but other than that he was fine. When the red flags started flying, the three karts in front of me kept on racing. I decided to slow down since it was a red flag and while that happened some of the more stupid kids decided to pass everyone. It took about ten minutes to get everything figured out. Once we started up again I fell back to third. One lap later I got passed on the straight. There was some kid who kept on trying to pass me on the straight but never could do it. I finished fourth in the heat race. After everyone else finished their heat races it was time for the mains. I had, for once, a great start for my main, still in fourth, but catching up to the guy infront of me. I was much faster than everyone in the infield, but once I got to the straight my engine let me down. After a while they still pulled away and I wasn't in their draft. I could of swore the was the number 61 of Matt Jackson trying to pass me but after the race my dad told me that he was actually pretty far back. I had to settle for fourth, which is still great. It was my fifth straight trophy. I can't wait until next race."},

I could hear the things that held the skin to the muscle, held the muscle to the bones, veins, tendons, it was all ripping away, curling inside itself. The sound of cloth ripping was too much, I squeezed my eyes together tighter.  Ground the enamel of my teeth away.  Pressure hit my body, a wave of nothing, wind almost.  She was gone.  There wasn't anything left, except the chair in which she sat, pulled out slightly. Tilted just to the left."},

And the wind has changed direction, now coming from the North which is nippy, but still allowing the weather to change. Way more fun than watching paint dry...&lt;br />Best of all, the February golds, or whatever they're called, have finally bloomed. Been waiting for days for them to get going, sitting curled up in their pistol shapes with just the hint of yellow coming through the outer green covering. But finally, they've opened their little yellow daffodil heads to say that Life isn't always gray and overcast. Hurray.&lt;br />And an update: a few minutes after originally posting this entry, snow is falling, from the North of course, but giant flakes. Hope the daffs don't mind!"},

Mine is no exception he has all three.  Today the dog (Keb-Mo) learned more about these gadgets than he would have liked.  Keb is a 126lb dog that lives inside with us.  He is a big baby, loves everyone and would not hurt a fly, but sometimes I get tied up at work and can not get free to walk him like I should.  He has grown acustomed to controlling his bladder very well, but every so often he does it in the house.  Today I came in early but I got a telephone call.  Keb was doing his get me out to pee dance, but I could not get off of the telephone call.  He left the room, shortly there after I heard a loud explosion type of sound, the dog flew through the air, hit the wall, and let out a blood curling yelp.  As I ran to see what had happened it was very clear.  Since he had to go very badly and I did not take him out he went to the nearist room, my sons, and pee'ed on the TV.  He did it on the side where the air vents are.  Needless to say he shorted out the tv and he got a very big shock.  The dog is alright, eventhough he may be even better potty trained than before.  The TV is fried, and I am sure Wal-Mart will not trade it for a new one.  Oh well no harm just one TV, and Keb Mo got a real leson in electricity."},

It is possible to take a simple idea and create a huge success. We think people who accomplish this work hard or have others to support them. We believe they are smarter, richer or in some way more endowed than we are. What we cannot see and do not measure is people's attitudes about what they do. Success begins with a positive attitude; it is the most valuable asset we may own. The people at the top did not fall there. They were willing to do whatever it took, taking the ups and the downs, asking for what they really wanted and staying focused until they got it. Success is not bought or inherited. It is a product of what we put out. Success begins with a good feeling about where we are and a positive attitude about where we want to be.     "},

I really didn't show much of anything today.  I, right now, am listening to sappy non love songs to make myself feel better, or maybe I just need to make myself sleepy, all of a sudden I am really thirsty...*stomps off to get some refreshing beverage* &lt;br />&lt;br />ok now I am back, so today I was totally tired and DK decided that since we were in quartets he wanted us to get up and sing, row by row, to see if we knew our pitches for John the Revelator, thank god, row 1 did ok.  I wasn't really paying attention to the other rows...so...I was daydreaming off in my own little world...sad but true, becuase I was thinking about going to work tomorrow....I absoulutely do not want to go....at all....thats being truthful for the first time ever, all the other times I was just saying it, but I really do not want to...I might cry right now, nothing is going right there, I am so just...not myself...I don't talk, and if I do, its only usually to the cashiers, because everyone treats me different...&lt;br />&lt;br />I still really like this guy at work and I don't know how I am going to talk to him tomorrow, it will be the first time we have worked together in awhile, and I am scared, and shy and I am definitly not going to know what to say.  Some things changed between us, and I grew apart and that makes me sad.  I got hurt, because I was naive and I aim to change that, I am not a stupid young child anymore, and no one is going to push me around and play with my emotions...no work relationships...AT ALL....I don't care who it is, I don't care if they like me, becuase I am moving I don't need to get into a stupid serious relationship...guys are dumb...really they are...&lt;br />&lt;br />I hate Valentines Day....I really do....so yeah going to work tomorrow and closing, not really looking forward to it, becuase I have to work with a whole bunch of guys...that I don't like anymore, well I like some of them as friends...and only that *I have to start saying that to myself, so I can believe it later on*&lt;br />&lt;br />well I really don't need to depress myself any longer and I don't want to bore any of you longer than I have to so, hope you all had a great day carrying around those dumb roses...they will all be dead in a couple of days anyway...mwahahahahahahahah...have I mentioned I hate Valentines Day?"},

First off it's summer. The trees have grown and are now green as a breath of the summer before everything aged. It's still spring to my family, but spring is perhaps the least favorite of all my seasons. I love how everything comes back, but my impatiance for waiting sometimes gets the best of me. when the trees have grown their buds, and shade can be cast by their leaves, then it's summer. It's only spring when the all the trees are budding. Flowers are always pre-mature in my mind. As the scouts to spring they bring hope that life will come again, but at some point are snowed on. My true memory of summer are the hot days on the lake, sailing in yet another regatta that my father made me do. Sliding my hand through the warm water I watch the path of air and fingers cut through something very much tangable, and yet not even real. At the moment clouds cover the sky, the potentail of rain exsists, but in this dry climate without the smell of ozone there's all but a small chance of rain. "},

Each of them invading NewPort in their own little way!  D.J. has gotten a hold of the sobby and vulnerable Marissa, Lindsay has brought fun into Ryan's life, Zach has been keeping Summer Vibing on High Frequencies, and Alex is taking control of Seth(who actually has been needing someone to do that for a while!)!  So how do you all feel about \"The New Kids On The Block?\"  Like'em or Hate'em, seems that they will be around for a while!  But I feel as if there is something in each of these characters that hasn't been let out yet!  We have Zach, who seems to be the perfect guy but most of the time if someone is too good to be true they usually are!  Same with the other's really, there is no way they could be exactly what Ryan, Marrissa, Seth, and Summer need without having luggage!  I mean this is \"NewPort\" we are talking about!  so if you all have any hunches or anything just post a comment and let everyone know what you think about the \"Move In\" by \"The New Kids On The Block\"!

Jill knows I can't write under pressure, and I hope I have driven the point sufficiently straightly home by obstinately refusing to add even a single byte of my written voice to this blog, over a period spanning approximately two years, without having felt even the slightest twinge of shame. I have held out against everything ranging from minor threats to major bouts of unconcern, never wavering. But today things change. Starting today I am going to write 500-ish words a day-ish and at the bidding of my own free will.&lt;br />&lt;br />Wow, that's 118 words already till the dot at the end of this line.&lt;br />&lt;br />Today I shall introduce myself, remaining as superficial as possible. No Sir! No soul searching for me! What I write will, I hope, set the pace of things to come.&lt;br />&lt;br />Mahesh was astounded. Mahesh was stunned. Mahesh brandished a Tommy Gun - Ed. Twenty seven shots were fired into the silent night, as four of the five bulky torsos, attached to swaying, knife wielding limbs, making threatening gestures, were neatly chopped into quarts. It was dark and quite. Mahesh was shocked. Mahesh dropped the gun and it fell to the ground making disagreeing noises. Mahesh began to run. It was time for dinner.&lt;br />&lt;br />Dinner begins at half past eight. The house is clean and brightly lit. Soft music is floating in the air. Mahesh is seated at the head of the table. The little kid sits directly opposite him but does not look at Mahesh. He is looking over his right shoulder at a Television screen. There is soup and peas mixed together on the table. The little kid gets up and changes the channel on the television. The bright lights suddenly change character. Dark rock music engulfs the room. The lights dance around the room in rapidly changing hues. There is no peace on earth, even inside of a man\u2019s house. There is a shotgun on the table - Dark, solid and comforting. Mahesh squeezes his arms around the shotgun and it goes off. There is silence once more. The infernal music is still playing.&lt;br />&lt;br />The little kid was stunned. There was blood in his soup and there was blood on the Television screen. He ran out of the room screaming for help. Two strong bulky hands descended on him at the door and the screaming stopped almost immediately. The fifth had found him. Things were never easy for Mahesh. He always had to fight for his life, but he had always won. Mahesh was invincible and things would remain the same today. He grabbed the right hand of the fifth and spun him around. There was no gun, none was needed. He pushed a knee into his guts. Then twisted his right wrist with an extended palm while simultaneously head butting him into the jaw, breaking it. As the fifth fell, he grabbed his neck and rotated it easily, almost effortlessly."},

No mail, no queries, no enhancements, no pending work\u2026 so far. Just 7 days away from completing 1 full year in Infosys makes me as excited as adding one year- every year to my age.&lt;br />This is the right day for me to remember and pen down the beautiful year that just few by leaving behind some scented petals.&lt;br />Memories of year 1:&lt;br />Just a few days of rest after the college life for few and a big leap from a small company for others, the journey into the heaven scented land of Mysore began. There is no better place to start his career than Infosys, to add to it, Mysore Infy. I can still feel the excitement, enthusiasm and bliss everyone had on 15th of March 05. In the vast campus with some big buildings and motherly maintained greenery added to the excitement.&lt;br />Some carried the work experience with them and many were still kids, Infy took the responsibility to bring them all to the same level, 1 year later I feel they were quite successful. A mentor as old in Infy as we were took the reigns of driving the 180 people wagon through 120 days. He had a special charm, the ability to convince people with a \u2018no\u2019 added with a naughty smile \u2013 Sujith. He did more than what we expected to make the journey smooth.&lt;br />&lt;br />The days of the college were back: books, tests, exams, results, library, and night-outs. The josh for people to study picked up as compre-started nearing. Tests were minor hiccups which impacted more in the beginning but were restricted only to book-bugs later on.&lt;br />It would be a crime on not to mention on how the days were spent in the luxurious hostel. Rs.50/day for it was not even sufficient for the daily smile of the care-taker of the rooms.&lt;br />Waking up at 7, switching on the TV on full volume, barging into the bathroom to freshen up, calling up Akhi, Shreyas, karthik too meet for breakfast, fighting for which row to sit in the class, cribbing on the same old menu, planning for an outing, coming back into the room, switching on the AC in full power \u2013 having a feel of the Arctic\u2019s, calling all the numbers in the telephone book, planning on which channel to watch, joining in again for dinner, lazy walk back to the hostel from the caf\u00e9, snehanshu\u2019s love stories, chat with Arko, Kanta, Bajpai, Siju, Anirudh, Narahari late in the nights sometimes on the rooftop and striking the bed thinking about the new friends you made. Well did I ever mention studies? Oh ya\u2026 that to was sometimes cramped into the daily fun-itinerary. Smoking restriction in the rooms brought out some fun filled days between Kanta and Ashwarya. I still cannot forget some wonderful moments spent on the stair-case of the hostels along with some entertainment stunts from Arijith. Cannot even forget the enjoyable trouble Ramesh n Anand gave with their particular \u2018requirements\u2019. There are many I have missed out but be sure I haven\u2019t forgotten any, not even the afghan dress of Priya or the string slippers of deepika for which I pulled their legs like crazy.&lt;br />&lt;br />Other than the resort err. Infy campus the time spent in Chamundi Hills, eating Mallige Idli\u2019s, wiling away time in the go-carting tracks, the travel from the remote infy campus to the city, ride on bikes, going in big groups- how they race through my mind leaving the trace of smile on my face.&lt;br />&lt;br />4 months in Mysore, the trip back home was one of the most cherished moments. The games we enjoyed in train with colleagues trying to out beat each other, the best of dumb-charades from Deepika, sleepy Soumya &amp; Shreyas, chirpy Priya n Chaitra, noisy Nidhi, silent but witty Akhi, the politically \u2018wrong\u2019 Kanta, the amazing technical discussions with Shaz n Karthik, the great drives in my car and of course \u2018one\u2019 most memorable turn, man I miss them a lot.&lt;br />&lt;br />Finally came the compre, the results brought shock n surprise to many, including me. I had no hopes to clear it. But the result was such that it found me wanting just 2 marks more to hit the \u2018A\u2019 mark.  But I was through, like many more\u2026 that\u2019s what most of them wanted anyway.&lt;br />&lt;br />The value of the time spent in Mysore was mainly felt when we were all parting ways to give back on what was spent on us by Infy. Tears rolled with the feeling that we might not see the people again with whom we spent the best parts of our lives. Messenger and mails would keep us together\u2026 even this faded out as the year went by.&lt;br />&lt;br />Training was over; finally, I was happy to be back in Bangalore with parents and friends. EISA it was, the department I would report to. The excitement to work there was short lived. I was desperate to change and fortunately moved over to the Banking domain. A fresher like me was graciously absorbed into the team. Raghu and Shwetha took pains to impart the procedures followed here, and of course taught the ever so confusing Directory structure of Finacle and complex vi editor. Then the usual monotonous work started, enhancing the tools and supporting them became a usual routine. Good work comes regularly but is short lived. Excitement in life now is just a bigger pay cheque and fatter perks.&lt;br />&lt;br />It was a wonderful journey. Passed though one of the most wonderful stations with probably the best people."},

I went to Outback for lunch today and I am EXTREMELY proud of myself. I hardly ate any sour cream (and no butter). They also have a very tasty fat free tomato dressing. I am bringing home 3 ounces of dead cow. I think this is the first time I have actually stopped eating before all the food on my plate was gone. My tummy feels full."},

Sadly the July 4th weekend is well endeth, and the grind resumes on the morrow. Between pending work projects and packing for my impending move to a new residence, I expect the rest of July to evaporate forthwith in a puff of smoke.&lt;br />&lt;br />Tonight, however, I await an atypical pounding from a Midwestern thunderstorm, which is surging towards us in Doppler shades of deep green and yellow, as if we are Isengard and the Ents are falling upon us with great vengence and furious anger.&lt;br />&lt;br />I hope to pick up on a redrafting of a short story this evening...a story I've allowed to lie far too dormant after a round of feedback from friends/family. We'll see how it goes.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the meantime, some recent viewings/observations:&lt;br />&lt;br />1) &lt;strong>Farenheit 9/11&lt;/strong>: Saw the film in a relatively packed theater today -- a riveting experience of op-ed film. Having willingly and unwillingly absorbed a considerable amount of buzz about the film's assertions prior to seeing it, and being stolid in my voting choice this fall, I didn't expected to be swayed nor surprised...but I &lt;em>was &lt;/em>swayed (in a \"cementing what I already believe\" way) and surprised (by the emotional impact of the soldiers and their families who appear in the film -- the ones who carry the true in burden in any war where lives are lost). It was a powerful, thought-provoking film, and an essential counterbalance to the overwhelming bullshit of the rightwing nuts in TV/radio broadcasting. Huzzah.&lt;br />&lt;br />2) &lt;strong>Salem's Lot&lt;/strong>: Anybody catch the recent TNT cable miniseries? The novel (by Stephen King) is an annual read for me, as I am continually bewitched by its entropic tempo, its ominous sense of predetermined doom for its characters, and above all its merciless humor. Anyways, it's one of my favorite King books, and yet again it's been fucked up in adaptation to the small screen.&lt;br />&lt;br />The best you can say about the 1979 version, starring David Soul and directed by Tobe Hooper (auteur behind the original \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"), is that it at least had James Mason as Straker. and a certain schlocky character to it (although depicting Barlow as Max Schrek's grunting cousin was a tragedy).&lt;br />&lt;br />In this latest remake I most of all resented the excess liberties writer Peter Filardi took in his liberal rearrangement of the characters and their relationships (Susan being estranged from Ben Mears rang particularly false, as did the confrontation with Father Calahan in NY). It had a few bright moments (Rutger Hauer in the dump site, the kids on the school bus), but overall a wasted opportunity.&lt;br />&lt;br />To be clear, I'm not opposed to making necessary cuts and rearrangements to adapt a novel to the visual medium --- Peter Jackson's LOTR being one of many great examples of how to do this correctly. But too much tweaking screws up the momentum of the original narrative. Don't second guess the King. Anyways, I imagine this will be out on DVD sooner or later, but I wouldn't waste my time. Read the book instead.&lt;br />&lt;br />3) &lt;strong>Open Water&lt;/strong>: My pick for the sleeper flick to see this fall. Looks like a cross between Blair Witch Project and Jaws. Wow. Trailers are playing before \"Farenheit 9/11\". Nothing like a little shark action to liven the post-summer blockbuster season."},

There were so many nice cars. OMG!  Sad thing is, I had to work at the show and not have too much time to look at the cars in the show.  I sat there and handed out flyers for hours.  There were soooo many people.  Good lord.  Anyways I also went to my uncles to go swimming have a little family get together for another birthday celebration for my sister.  So today was Fathers Day.  I spent a lot of time with my dad.  We went out to eat.  Then we went out to my grandfathers grave.  It was a very sad moment.  I miss him very much.  Then we went to my aunts house to go swim and eat dinner.  It was a very nice day.  So yeah next week is just gonna be great.  The only good thing will be my girlfriend's birthday on Friday.  Cant wait for that.  But lets see....Monday....Orthodontist.....Tuesday......Court for those bastards who put a gun to my head.........Wednesday.......I get to get my Wisdom teeth taken out!.....And the rest of the week......Soreness!"},

Since this was a real shower and not a movie shower it is really too small for two people to share but the upside is that our naked bodies are almost always in contact. As is usually the case I spend too much time washing body parts that probably don't need cleaning but my wife humors me and her breasts are amazingly clean. They are large and real, they don't float lifelessly in midair like the large saline ones that grace most magazine covers today but instead sway with her every movement. Something that drives me insane is watching her breasts move in synchronicity with my thrusts as I make love to her. Now the foreplay is done and the soap is all rinsed away. She turns her back to me and puts her face into the shower and lets the water run through her hair. I slowly start kissing a trail down her spine until I come to her beautiful ass. Running my hands over her hips I run my tongue down the cleavage of her buttocks then gently nibble on her left cheek. She giggles and turns her body around then leans her back against the shower wall. The stream of water is directed at her chest and forms a river running between her breasts, down her stomach then between her legs where it turns into a waterfall which cascades to the tub. I crouch down and place my face in the falling water. As I lean forward and kiss the point where her left leg meets her body she raises her right leg and drapes it over my shoulder. My attention shifts and my tongue finds it's way to her. Her hair is trimmed short and her sex is perfection. I separate her and start to massage her with my tongue, avoiding her most sensitive of places my mouth explores her delicious folds until I can taste her essence mixing with the water from the shower. Even through the warm water I can feel her heat coming out towards my face. Finally, I concentrate my energies on her center, the nub of flesh that I worship and I can feel her hips start to rhythmically shift. My other hand comes up and I slowly enter her with the finger that bears the ring which sealed our promise to love eachother forever. Time begins to blur, I become too focused to think about things which would normally drive one to distraction, the water flowing across my face and filling my mouth, my knees and ankles which are probably numb, my back which is hunched over and supporting my wife against the wall of the shower. Finally, it happens, her hips thrusting violently against my face, I can feel her inside relax then grip at my ring finger, the leg over my shoulder tightens across the back of my neck and her other leg relaxes so I am now supporting most of her weight on my shoulders. After a short rest I stand and hold her tight against me and kiss the top of her head. My legs are weak and my feet are numb but I am in heaven."},

And then, on Tuesday and Wednesday, relax into the idea of your smallness in the world -- not as any comment on your influence, but just to enjoy a healthy and productive instance of modesty. Like most emotions, this will pass. Thursday and Friday you're feeling the polar opposite of modest: You are huge. You are Paul Bunyan. The world is a forest and you're going to chop it down.

Quite honestly, I'm on the proverbial fence with this one. I'm an 'at will' employee where I work, which means if they suddenly decide that I'm too fat, too white, too Republican, too much of an OU fan, too ugly, or just really really want to hire someone else to fill my position, they can tell me goodbye at any second. Luckily, I'm in an industry that few people want to work in, and with high turnover, so any happy, loyal employee such as myself has pretty good job security. (Yes, I really do love my job!)&lt;br />&lt;br />But if I started posting lies and half-truths, or even whole truths that paint my employer in a bad light, would they be justified in firing me? And just who are they firing? \"Nixon Casablanca\" (not my real name.) Yes, that' s my real picture, but couldn't I just as easily post as someone else? Or use a fake picture? Or post as a pet armadillo? &lt;br />&lt;br />I don't blog on company time, mainly because we have no internet access at work. If we did, I probably would, but only because I mostly work graveyard during which time we watch the kids sleep (and make sure they don't wake up and try to escape, stab eachother, etc.) We do have a LOT of paperwork to keep us busy, but we still manage to have several hours of idle time a night, which is usually filled with reading or light television watching.&lt;br />&lt;br />So, I've reached no conclusion, but then again, neither did the news story. Where do YOU stand?"},

Probably Shakespeare. Or maybe Sting. But at the moment, it's the sentence that best describes my tragic flaw: my inability to change. I don't think I'm alone in this. The more I get to know other people, the more I realize it's kind of everyone's flaw. &lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">Staying exactly the same for as long as possible, standing perfectly still... It feels safer somehow. And if you &lt;em>are&lt;/em> suffering, at least the pain is familiar. Because if you took that leap of faith, went outside the box, did something unexpected... Who knows what other pain might be out there waiting. Chances are it could be even worse. So you maintain the status quo. Choose the road already traveled. And it doesn't seem that bad, not as far as flaws go. You're not a drug addict. You're not killing anyone... Except maybe yourself a little. &lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">But, when we finally do change, I don't think it happens like an earthquake or an explosion, where all of a sudden we're like this different person. I think it's smaller than that. The kind of thing most people wouldn't even notice unless they looked really close. Which, thank God, they never do. But you notice it. Inside, to you that change feels like a world of difference. And you hope that it is. That this is the person you get to be forever... that you'll never have to change again. &lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"justify\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">- - E.B.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>"},

This is Jon and I\u2019m here for another entry of YMU.&lt;br />&lt;br />I had a good weekend. My school was showing Ray and I saw it on Friday. Definitely Oscar worthy now that I\u2019ve seen it for myself. I\u2019ve been reading The Color Purple for my African American Lit class. It\u2019s different. It\u2019s told in prayers. I like it. I gotta see the movie after I\u2019m done.&lt;br />&lt;br />Now about the topic. Today I went to church and I was feeling a little bad about a few things. Lately I\u2019ve been feeling that I don\u2019t have time to things I want to do. It\u2019s always homework. I do my best not worry and trust God in everything, but it seems easier said than done most of the time. During worship I prayed to God to give me encouragement. Next thing I know one of the disciples had a verse that came to his heart and it spoke to me. 2 Corinthians 12:7-10. Paul was going through a rough time and the Lord said to him \u201cMy grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.\u201d Paul realized that even though he was feeling week he was going to rejoice in Christ\u2019s strength and let him take over. That\u2019s something that I need to do. Having apprehension and all this stuff won\u2019t make your problems any better. You just have to bring them to Jesus and trust that everything is going to be brighter.&lt;br />&lt;br />I do have a bit of bad news. There was a shooting at a mall in my hometown, Kingston, NY. My mom told me about it today. It was one gunman and he injured a man in the leg.  Please pray for that man that everything turns out all right. He's in critical condition.&lt;br />&lt;br />I want to leave on a good note, so seeing as how Valentine\u2019s Day is tomorrow, I have a special poem I wrote for the occasion. It\u2019s called Real Love.&lt;br />&lt;br />My mind was boggled with woe and doubt&lt;br />My body double over by a massive amount&lt;br />I started to teeter and began to quit&lt;br />Defeat was something I had to admit&lt;br />But someone grabbed on and started to pull&lt;br />Soon I was up and saw you in full&lt;br />You comforted me giving assurance&lt;br />That you\u2019ll be there for the next occurrence&lt;br />&lt;br />I strolled down a path of darkness and forbid&lt;br />I tripped and fell and scurried and hid&lt;br />Your eyes filled with anger and mouth filled with scold&lt;br />But you wrapped me up close in your loving hold&lt;br />When you fixed my scrapes I didn\u2019t understand&lt;br />Tell me why you\u2019re here I said with command&lt;br />You looked in my eyes and in a sweet voice&lt;br />You said I\u2019m here because that is my choice&lt;br />I love you and it hurt to see you in pain&lt;br />Then I had a strange feeling that I yearned would remain&lt;br />&lt;br />A sense of joy exploded inside&lt;br />And my long journey had its demise&lt;br />I had traveled to seek a real, true love&lt;br />When all that was needed was to look above&lt;br />&lt;br />I\u2019ll be back with more soon. Until then this is Jon saying, \u201cGod\u2019s love is sufficient.\u201d"},

The accident I was in wasn't major but it got me thinking that life is too short and that I should always be careful on the streets.

We have all seen the \"brave\" weatherman (or just the guy that drew the short straw) in a yellow rain suit standing out in the storm with his microphone in had trying to describe what it is like in 60+mph wind and rain.&lt;br />&lt;br />Before it hits, they cover the evacuation operations and show people boarding up windows preparing for the storm. They interview people who are leaving, asking them where they are going and if they are afraid their house will be damaged when they get back. &lt;br />&lt;br />But one thing I hear every time, one comment from a citizen that occours every time a hurrican hits. Even last year when four hit Florida in a row. I don't understand this comment. Maybe it is because I do not live there and live where things like this or other natural disasters do not occur.&lt;br />&lt;br />The comment that bothers me is when someone says that they had to drive to the next town to find a generator or that there was a rush at the hardware store to buy generators. What, they didn't buy one the last four times? Or did they buy one, but need a different one for this particular hurricane. What happened to the one they bought the last hurricane? I would think that if you lived where the treat of hurrican is always there, people would already have a generator or a plan of escape.&lt;br />&lt;br />I am not going to say these people are stupid, but come on. Every time, the news goes through the same old story, same lines, same consultants. And when they talk to people in the path of the hurricane, it is the same story every time. I had to search everywhere for a generator.&lt;br />&lt;br />Well, there it is. I am watching Fox News and there is the weather man standing in the rain trying to describe how hard the rain is falling and how hard the wind is. His rain suit is yellow. I don't know why it bothers me. Maybe because it seems just so stupid. It is a HURRICANE! Of course the wind is blowing. Of course it is raining. Of course the waves are pounding.&lt;br />&lt;br />Ok. That is enough of my ranging&lt;br />&lt;br />This is One Man's Opinion"},

Basenji's are an African Hound dog. They are used for hunting small game. Our 4 year old 'senji's, Bob (25 lbs) and Lucy (23 lbs) decided they didn't like Jake, our 120 pound Lab-Rottie mix. They proceeded to open a can of whup ass on him. It didn't work. Jake cleaned their clocks. Lucy had a front leg broken and foot nearly chewed off. Bob had major muscle damage to his upper rear leg, his penis was bitten off and belly ripped open. Our Vet managed to repair them to near perfect condition. This was the first time Bob had attacked Jake. Lucy tried it two years ago and received injuries to her head, neck and chest. Basenji's are not known for having good sense. We did not buy these dogs. There's no dog in the world worth $600-$1000 each. All our dogs have been strays. Four years ago on Memorial Day weekend my wife opened the front door to get the newspaper and they were curled up on the porch bench. They ran in the house, jumped on the sofa and went to sleep. They had no collars, tags or microchip. We spent a month trying to find their owners without luck. Basenji's are really weird dogs. They are like a cat in a dog costume. They don't bark but make a noise like a human yawn sound. They will eat nearly anything that will fit down their throats. Bob's favorite treat is oranges. Lucy likes cucumbers with blue cheese dressing.     "},

Basic tracks were cut at the Tempermill Studios in Ferndale, Michigan and ensuing overdubs were done with the Third Monk mobile unit at various locations around Metro Detroit.&lt;br />&lt;br />Since the disc was mastered by Gavin Lurssen at the Mastering Lab, songs have already been aired on WSDP-FM, WHFR-FM, WRAX-FM and the band have performed live on the nationally syndicated Mitch Albom show as well as in the studios of WHFR-FM at Henry Ford Community College.  Further non-comercial radio airplay and a fall tour to college campuses in the midwest are in the cards for the band.  Let's wish them the best!&lt;br />&lt;br />Thanks to everyone who participated in the iTunes/Pepsi promotion.  With the deadline for use of Pepsi product caps with free downloads passing on May 23, 2005, we are grateful to anyone who had the opportunity to download Third Monk Records artists for free.  Songs from Third Monk Records artists remain available at all paid download sites from iTunes to Aol.com to Audiolunchbox.com.&lt;br />&lt;br />After the analog tape scare we had back in December, it is a great, great thing that Quantegy tape has been bought by 2 past employees.  The analog tape domain is precious and without it, the record making process would be seriously hindered.  Even in the face of the Digital Audio Workstation, the essence of analog tape can still be an essential ingredient to produce amazing  recordings of great songs.  Better still to think that Emtec (BASF) is back in the fray and ATR Services in Pennsylvania will be making their own analog tape.&lt;br />&lt;br />The music industry should continue to regain it's strength in the next 5 to 10 years while it recovers from the attack of the evil 3-headed hydra- namely Corporate Radio, illegal MP3 downloading and the advent of the Digital Audio Workstation.  With great trepidation, we should all be concerned and closely monitor the Elliot Spitzer Payola investigation in New York State and encourage legislation to be passed in Washington, D.C. to eliminate the ridiculous concept of songs as 'paid' advertisements.  As for the rest, everyman is empowered with their Digitial Audio Workstations and the industry finally has a grasp on how to make money selling mp3s.&lt;br />&lt;br />Let's hope for the best!"},

Great games and an awesome National Championship game.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Ducks performance was the only downer. We should have won. We played poorly and sadly I have to point to the coaching staff and their decisions.&lt;br />&lt;br />As for the rest of the top games, wow, Ohio State really impressed me in the Fiesta Bowl against Notre Dame, the Buckeyes are impressive. The Sugar Bowl, it looked like after the end of the first half that they would both score 60 points, amazing offenses. It was a fun first half of football. Of course they slowed down in the second half and it was a battle to the end.&lt;br />&lt;br />All of the BCS bowls were battles, the Orange Bowl, wow! Three overtimes! The missed field goals, the intensity was great, I was sure glad Kevin Kelly came through with his third chance to win the game. I am not sure he would have lived to old age if he would have missed another. Paterno and Bowden are the two winningest coaches in D-I football battling it out for over 4 hours (79 years old and 76 years old respectively). It was cool to watch.&lt;br />&lt;br />Then there came the Rose Bowl for the National Championship. I was saying before the game, this is the most significant football game of the century. Texas and USC, all the stories to be told, wow. Texas ranked number two all season, had an amazing year, routing most all of the teams they came up against. After the game commentators were asking if Vince Young (runner-up Heisman candidate) might be the best quarterback ever! He is amazing, he ran for 200 yards and He threw for 267 yards, in the Rose Bowl for the National Championship! This Young\u2019s second year in a row winning the Rose Bowl, his combined yardage and amazing \u2026. 839 yards in two Rose Bowls.&lt;br />&lt;br />\"That,\" USC coach Pete Carroll said, \"is an extraordinary football player.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />\"Vince is truly one of the great competitors to ever play college football,\" coach Mack Brown said Wednesday night. \"He has got a tremendous amount of confidence. He just exudes that confidence.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />And the USC Trojans \u2026 Matt Leinart comes back passing up tens of millions of dollars this year to go for his 3rd National Championship in a row. He was the Heisman winner in 2004, the top player in the whole nation. This year Reggie Bush, running back for USC, wins the Heisman and he deserved it he is like no other, he runs by defensive players like they are 7th grade girls. Two Heisman winners on one team playing for their 3rd National Championship, guarding a 34 game winning streak, they had not lost since 2003!&lt;br />&lt;br />Now the game, wow, they battle to the final seconds. There was no way to know the final outcome until the buzzer rang. Intense. Wow. That was fun."},

Who do they blame then.  I truly believe Ted Kennedy's remarks comparing our current struggle against terrorist to Viet Nam as the catalyst that caused the deaths of over one hundred soldiers in April.  Comments or opinions like his should be hehind closed doors and not thrown out as political garbage.  Our enemies see weakness in those like Ted Kennedy and the candidate he supports John Kerry.  I would like to see the journalist look into the Awards &amp; Decorations writings at the time he served.  I would like an interview with the officer that wrote up the papers to submit for his awards.  I also would like to know the statistics of how many awards were given to the men and women on his boat during his four month tour in Nam.  Would those statistics show that John Kerry and his brothers received more than the average for that short of tour.  Till Later........."},

I went on BBC London last night to discuss the next day's papers witha very funny woman called Stella Duffy and the DJ, both of whom are ludicrously quick and hilariously funny. I was a bit stuffy alongside and my lack of encyclopaedic knowledge about showbiz didn't help. But whatever, the highlight of the evening was the cab ride home. I was driven by a Bulgarian guy who had made and lost fortunes in Bulgaria and told me a few explicit truths - summed up as 'don't waste your youth worrying'. I've often been under the impression that life is sending me clues, very much in the way omens are sugested by Paolo Coelho in the Alchemist. Except I don't believe in a higher power - at all - and so it makes it easy for me to ignore these impressions I get. But the truths are getting clearer and louder - I can't keep ignoring the evidence that I am wasting my life. I am pissed off - I am pissed off with my flatmate, who is also pissed off with life, I am pissed off with my job, where the confidence has drained out of me to an unrealised extent. I am pissed off with my inability to get out of bed to get to work on time, my inability to organise my life at all, my inability to get and hold down a relationship. I have all that anyone could want - I look reasonably nice, I'm quite intelligent, quite witty. I'm not the best at anything, but I have talents. Yet I find it so difficult to do or say anything at all. My only role among my friends is as a kind of eccentric. Maybe I have CJD. I'm still wearing my Dad's shirts. I never iron them. Myt trousers don't fit. Blah fucking blah - I bore even myself. Basically my life is barely tolerable. But I need to try to make money somehow. I like learning Arabic. I like salsa but it's hard to keep from thinking it's an exam rather than a pleasure. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. And I certainly don't know why I am putting all this up on a website next to a photo of me (well; noone is reading so it barely amtters). How postmodern, showing all the workings, except I don't feel like anything is working at all. and I feel the longer it doesn't the further away any prospect of realising any potential recedes. I am so used to failure now, personally and professionally, that I am slipping into a role of a bitter, disatisfied person whose creative synapses have withered through lack of use. I retain a certain arrogance, thinking wrongly that I could have been a prince, but under that increasingly brittle shell I am hollow. One day I will just collapse and the pieces will simply blow away."},

She shut the door behind her, and I started freaking out because I didn't think I could finish it. Melissa and I started talking, and Melissa told me one of the answers. She didn't really *say* it, she was singing it, over and over again. As she was doing this both our parents walked into the room. Melissa didn't seem to notice, and she kept singing the answer. I tried to shut her up, but our parents saw that she was giving me an answer. The teacher walked in a few seconds later, oblivious that Melissa gave me and answer. However, my dad told her! The teacher became VERY angry, and grabbed our tests from us and told us that we failed the class for cheating. I started crying and begging her to reconsider, saying that we were not cheating. I really did not believe that we had cheated at all. I was so afraid I would not graduate on time because I would have to retake the class."},

Does it move? Is it static? Is today tomorrow\u00b4s yesterday? What is humanity\u00b4s role or purpose in this static continuum?&lt;br />&lt;br />Civilizations appear and disappear. We appear and disappear and between one event and the other, time gives us its precious gift, the gift of existence. Life, death , growth, decay, happiness, joy, decease, sadness, healing, wealth, our own survival depends on time. Everything depends on it. Everything changes between one event and another. With the passage of time everything changes, even static things age in constant flux and transformation. We are not the same creatures we started out being nor are we the same persons we will become. We transform. One being completely different in body and mind. Evolved from simple to complex through growth. We are an expression of time, change and evolution.&lt;br />&lt;br />Is evolution, growth, transformation or time creations of a higher power or a mindless universe ?&lt;br />These writings do not attempt to deal with those questions, they only attempt to establish certain links and correlations between them: Evolution takes time. Time expresses itself through evolution. Evolution is a transformation.&lt;br />Time is all.&lt;br />&lt;br />Evolution and transformation come about as an expression. The Human expression exists through inter-dependent phenomena. An expression with an ultimate goal: Full development. In social evolution the goal is to express a human being fully self-contained, physically and intellectually with no further need of corrective after thought devices like laws or archaic arithmetical monetary systems to deal with each other. What for? if each human is complete and total, developed through: Knowledge. Extensive education, as much as each person desires. A social minimum> 20 years? 25? 30?&lt;br />&lt;br />A society that exists in time like anything else; evolves. It makes its developmental pattern from simple to complex automatically through growth and change . The goal of any society is to make things better through some means or other. If its members are not allowed to fully develop, intellectual corollary systems will be developeded to fill in the vacuum. Social institutions, correctional specially, will obligatorally be developed through the evolutive mechanism. Laws will have to be created and enforced depending on what was not fully acomplished in the preceding evolutive step. If in the human relations area; laws, courts, police forces will fill in the vacuum. If in the spiritual area, religions will fill in the vacuum.&lt;br />&lt;br />To survive on this planet, humanity has experienced the hard way to interact and exchange within itself and with every specie on it, one way or another. The earliest was the barter system; with the animal kingdom: I\u00b4ll keep you, I\u00b4ll feed you, I\u00b4ll take care of you, in exchange -- Ill take your hide or your meat. With the plant and mineral kingdom it has been basically the same exchange plus, we have learned not to pollute or we will not be able to breath.&lt;br />&lt;br />In bartering, if there are human beings not fully develloped, who do not understand the laws of equilibrium, ( equal exchange ), in other words think that they can or should get something for nothing, then social evolution will take over and fill the void: it will develop systems that will force them if not to undertand at least to make them live in relative harmony with the imposed laws, regulations of the corrollary corrective systems.  &lt;br />Among the developed systems: the monetary system.&lt;br />&lt;br />If knowledge is not diseminated equally among the members of a society and some remain somewhat ignorant or completly ignorant of their roles in their group or society, geographical area, planet, space in time, history or universe and if barriers like language or distance seem insourmoutable like in societies early development, the monetary corrective system will become an evolutionary necessity.&lt;br />&lt;br />Money: An artificial mathematical exact systems of transaction, to help with the vacuum that ignorance produces. If the individual does not know how to deal with the rest of the group, rules will be imposed on him.&lt;br />The monetary system depends on its own inherent rules and regulations that must be adhered to for it to work, for as in any mindles system it works on his own terms.&lt;br />If a corrective system like the monetary one is used, societys highest potential has not been reached.&lt;br />&lt;br />Money performs at its best in concret terms, with tangibles. It does not understand or deal with feelings, morals or ethics. Usualy, morals suffer like in the following example: we are always chasing after the better deal. The more for less deal. In shopping, we want more for less, to the point that we are willing to turn a blind eye if a product has to be manufactured in a less developed country where labor is cheaper even if the working conditions are sub-human.&lt;br />Another aspect of money or mathematical transaction that is almost imposible to understand is the disconnect.&lt;br />&lt;br />The disconnect relates to when something has or appears to have no connection with another, example: Addiction to drugs. Nine out of ten drug addicts at the time they purchase them do not relate to the chain of events unleashed at that moment, specially when many of the events will happen to other peoples in other lands far away from them in time and space.&lt;br />&lt;br />The \"more for less\" aspect is especially difficult to assimilate specially when dealing with intangibles like the ones mentioned above, it engenders a host of problems and is based soley on mechanical transaction, a transaction that is sometimes not easily understood by a not sufficiently developed or evolutionized or knowledgeable person. In that sense, if we continue to have under educated people we will have the same problem. The numbers game can be manipulated in other ways by those who know.&lt;br />&lt;br />More work from employee: for less wages.&lt;br />&lt;br />More price: for less quality.&lt;br />&lt;br />And on , and on , endlessly.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />The more for less theory is applied throughout the system, inflation is a vital part of it and we are constantly trying to catch up with it. Quality of life is forced to be cheepened in every respect. It is the only way the system can work.&lt;br />New language emerges such as: Corporate Economic Restructuring. Whereby the company must produce more with less workers and cheaper materials and thousands of jobs and lives are erased and destroyed.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />UTOPIA (Does it exist?)&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />There is no such thing as social human utopia.&lt;br />&lt;strong>It is the ultimate goal of evolution ( any evolution ) to attain perfection&lt;/strong>. Eventually language will include words like cheat, steal, rob, even the word truth only in a historical context \"when man was underdeveloped and there existed social corollary suport systems to fill in .&lt;br />&lt;br />Basic law of time: Relativity.&lt;br />To the cave man democracy is utopian. To us they are undeveloped.&lt;br />Obviously the best society is one based on truth and trust alone with no need for correcting systems like money because clearly; if you are fully and totally developed, you will always do what is ethically and truthfully correct and to the end : Truth is the great equalizer.. A trust that comes about becaues you know that whatever anybody says or does (exept for mistakes or lack of knowledge which will be aknowleged and quickly corrected) must be true and ethical because there are no hidden purposes, pressures or agendas.&lt;br />Only mankind strives to understand concepts of time and evolution in its relentless persuit for perfection. The only question is : How much time will it take us to fully accept that fact and how long are we to make the intervening steps of understanding and acceptance:&lt;br />days,&lt;br />years,&lt;br />millenia?&lt;br />It is hard for us to imagine or accept from our point of view, a more different world but it is only a question of relativity.&lt;br />If and only if EVERY AND EACH human being on this planet is fully develloped socially through knowledge and education so that we have no need for corrolary systems like:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />* Money&lt;br />Religion&lt;br />Law&lt;br />Law Enforcement&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />*These 4 concepts will only exist in history books.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />The only motivation needed for a fully developed person to act is the eagerness to participate in an environment that is truthful, fair, exiting and willing to share all its physical, spiritual and intellectual riches. Social and cultural evolutions are intrinsically linked to their environment. All three are depndent on each other and develop accordingly, to a certain extent they react automatically.&lt;br />If corrective systems are allowed to exist for too long, they become the norm and they grow and develop themselves and with beings as sophisticated, sensitive and social as human beings, they bring around the problem of invisible social barriers and intellectual barriers like political division and money division.&lt;br />&lt;br />If a well developed colony of ants or bees who had reached the peak of their development were to be put in the same predicament, they would soon find themselves in our same situation> at odds with each other.&lt;br />As long as we hold on to our knowledge vacuums where some members of our societies remain undeveloped, socialy we will not be free.&lt;br />We will remain slaves to our inability of seeing beyond the next curve.&lt;br />&lt;br />The only way out is to lift up from ignorance every single child alive, everywhere in this planet.&lt;br />&lt;br />The answer is : Knowledge through education. So we do not have to deal with the corrective systems.&lt;br />&lt;br />No money.&lt;br />No religion. ( Spirituality, Yes)&lt;br />No Laws.&lt;br />&lt;br />No need for any of them. If every single one of us is illuminated inside by knowledge."},

I went to the TBS/Blink concert..I've never really been much of a blink fan but major props to Travis. I was watching him drum the ENTIRE performance. And of course, Taking Back Sunday did wonderfully. I was extrememly stoked even though I wasn't close to the stage. I even got autographs :). Yeah and an even bigger plus... I didnt have to work this morning. I woke up at Sam's with Cecily and it was raining so the day is getting better as it goes on. I think I might actually start using this thing. So yeah, later."},

I like to call it \u201cpeople power\u201d. What used to be called consumers have become the Internet producers. It stared with message boards, went on to P2P, online gaming, photo sharing and finally nuevo journalism or blogging. It gives social networking a whole new direction. The act of sharing be it their day, thoughts, opinions or photos, these new producers are dictating where the Internet begins and ends. The new producers of content will inevitably take over from mainstream media.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the process of sharing is where a gateway to the future of the internet was revealed. When each person began to reveal their truths and realized that there are more similarities between people than there are differences. This awareness has created a power stream and thus a shift in the collective consciousness. A new form of thought leadership is bound to emerge from this. But unlike the lone figure standing on a pedestal speaking for his people, this it will be the collective voice of all humanity. And the microphone thru which they speak will be the INTERNET.&lt;br />&lt;br />That can never be a bad thing. Because for once decisions will be made collectively. In the process of doing so, the connection the internet provides will show that ultimately we want the same things.These communities are already talking and the power brokers are listening. With this change, it begs the question, what will the Internet become?&lt;br />&lt;br />The internet will become the channel and the reference point for every new invention. It will become an ecosystem that states what we want, what we need, and how we need it. The way businesses deal with this will be the challenge. Because previously, an invention was made and marketed and only after getting feedback was it improved upon (Microsoft is a good example) and then it went on to be called innovation. This time around, the winning invention is the one that was commissioned by the producers of the internet. Not literary commissioned, but as natural progression that comes when millions of people around the globe share their views, thoughts and opinions about what stays and what goes.&lt;br />&lt;br />It will not only shape the economics and politics of the world but lift the collective consciousness of humanity to level never before experienced. With blogging and other forms social networking, there is now a source where almost every human mind is plugged into. This source is an invaluable tool that will make a difference whether we like it or not."},

Na a\u00e7\u00e3o, ela explica que o iPod Touch de 16 GB de seu filho de 15 anos estava no bolso da cal\u00e7a, durante uma aula. De repente, o garoto teria ouvido \u201co barulho de um estouro e imediatamente sentiu uma sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de queimadura em sua perna\u201d. Foi ent\u00e3o, segundo o documento, que ele percebeu que \u201co equipamento estava em chamas\u201d."},

Almonds, honey, orange blossoms and earth. Luscious, with oranges, almonds and stewed peaches, but not at all heavy. Very smooth, with a lemon-meringue finish.&lt;br />&lt;br />Golden and green-tinged. A nose of nectar -- pears, apples, orange blossoms and peaches -- and roasted mixed nuts: walnuts, almonds, pistachios. Mouth-coating, with ripe apricots, great acids and egg-white fluffiness on the long, clean finish. Surprisingly light on its feet.&lt;br />[nowides] OUR FAVORITES&lt;br /> &lt;br />[Tastings]&lt;br />In a tasting of Sauternes from the excellent 2001 vintage, these were our favorites.&lt;br />&lt;br />Sigh. Wait, where were we? Oh, here: Every year around this time, we're asked something like this: \"I'd like to get a bottle of wine for a friend who's really into wine, but he already buys good stuff by the case, so what could I possibly give him?\" This year, here's the answer: a bottle of Sauternes from the well-regarded 2001 vintage, which is just arriving in stores now. This is a gift that will show research and good taste, and it's truly one that will keep on giving for many years, but we'll get back to that.&lt;br />&lt;br />There is no sweeter gift than Sauternes, and we mean that literally. Sauternes, from the Bordeaux region of France, is the world's greatest sweet wine. (The name, sometimes spelled Sauterne, was appropriated by some American wineries for sweet, simple wines, but they're unrelated.) It is made from grapes -- Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc, sometimes along with Muscadelle -- that have been allowed to remain on the vine in misty conditions until they are attacked by botrytis cinerea, the famous \"noble rot\" that shrivels the grapes and concentrates the juice into a rare and remarkable nectar.&lt;br />&lt;br />Leaving the grapes on the vine until they are attacked by mold is obviously risky -- in fact, some Sauternes producers don't make any wine at all in troubled years. And harvesting those grapes and making this wine is labor-intensive and expensive. So these wines should cost a fortune, but, on the whole, they don't, we're happy to say, because sweet wines generally aren't in vogue.&lt;br />&lt;br />Genuinely Exciting&lt;br />&lt;br />But here's the thing: True wine lovers know the real value of Sauternes, and that's why this is such a great present. While many of the world's sweet wines are flabby sugar bombs, Sauternes is not. Think about the ripest, freshest, juiciest piece of fruit you've ever tasted. Sure, it was sweet, but the primary taste was fruit, not sugar, and the sweet tastes were probably balanced with some tartness and good acidity. That's the wonder of Sauternes. Its abundant acids, great earthiness and ripe fruit taste like juicy, fresh-from-the-tree-or-vine fruit, not like sugar. In a good Sauternes, the smell itself is both sweet and nicely acidic, making it mouth-watering even before it's sipped. At their best, these wines are genuinely exciting.&lt;br />&lt;br />Did we say earthiness? Heaven knows this is hard to explain, but in the very best Sauternes -- and especially the famous Chateau d'Yquem, the greatest Sauternes -- we sometimes feel as though we're drinking nectar that's been filtered through rich earth. It's that elemental -- and unique.&lt;br />&lt;br />The 2001 Yquem, which has been widely praised, hasn't yet been released. (It might be available for Christmas, at $400 a bottle or more.) But many other Sauternes from 2001 have hit the shelves, so we figured we'd pick up enough for a large tasting to see how they are. We set no price limit, so we ultimately spent up to $129.95, though most of the wines were less than $50. We bought wines labeled Sauternes and labeled Barsac, which is one of the villages of Sauternes and is allowed to use its own name. The wines of Barsac are generally considered somewhat lighter and perhaps a little more elegant than many wines labeled simply Sauternes.&lt;br />&lt;br />We are sometimes told that fine French wines aren't available in California -- can you imagine? -- so we made a point of buying most of the wines for this tasting there. We tasted the wines blind in flights over several nights, and we're here to tell you: These are delicious, memorable wines. Wine after wine offered a luscious nose of orange blossoms and brioche, a rich taste of fruit, earth and nuts, and a lingering finish of sweet, ripe fruit that sometimes left us at a loss for words. Or perhaps we just didn't want to speak and risk losing the state of mind that the taste had induced.&lt;br />&lt;br />Golden Tastes&lt;br />&lt;br />During the tasting, John asked Dottie how we could describe Sauternes that might convince a sweet-resistant wine drinker to give it a try. Dottie thought for a moment and replied: \"It's like the sun. There's a gleaming richness to it. It tastes golden. It's smooth, with a sweetness that bursts in your mouth and then surprises you with such a clean, bracing finish.\" As we said, sigh.&lt;br />&lt;br />We ultimately couldn't pick just one wine for our best of tasting. Two wines, both of which we rated Delicious, qualified for the top spot: Chateau de Malle, the wine we described above as \"the total package,\" and the other one above, Chateau Nairac from Barsac, which had the fluffy finish, something you will just have to experience to fully understand.&lt;br />&lt;br />But this is important: These wines won't be at their best for many years. In fact, our advice for new parents who want to lay down wine for their child is always Sauternes because it ages so well for so long. Not only that -- and, for your present, this is particularly important -- but the wine gets more and more beautiful to look at as it ages. Even in youth, Sauternes is beautiful in its clear bottle -- golden, sometimes with green highlights. With each year, the wine gets even more stunning, with its gold becoming dark and richer-looking. Long before the bottle is open, it has already given such joy. So this holiday season, give your friend a bottle of 2001 Sauternes, but be sure to write something like this on the label: \"Happy holidays 2005. May your life, like this wine, get better every year.\""},

So I was confronted. I told them that, that day my mother and I had fought and I had went to my old appartment and in my old room my ex roommate had locked her dog in there and he shit all over all my shit. I was sooo upset that when I came home from my interview I changed my clothes and went to a friends house. I stayed there untill Mark calls over there and says you need to come home we need to talk.... So yesterday I was talkin to my mother and I found out that she is moving to PA if she doesnt have an appartment by July 8th... So of course I was upset about that... Then I confronted the person she would be moving in with and I told her how I felt about what she was doing to my family and she just didnt care and said that I was a selfish little bitch who didnt care about my mother. So needless to say I have had a very shitty few days."},

It's crazy, I haven't cried this much since... I never had I think.&lt;br />&lt;br />But it's not the kinda tearing apart self-pity crying, and it's not the crying that comes with a big black hole like when you have lost someone. It's the kind of crying that's like a big exclamation mark after the wonderful summer we've had together.&lt;br />&lt;br />I missed you when we were apart for two hours, and the weekend you were in \u00d6rebro was relatively easy to cope with because there came a monday after that weekend. This is bigger and I don't know what to do with myself.&lt;br />&lt;br />I've rolled up my sleeves, and the orange is waiting for me. I've also made a thermos of the tea that you bought in the beginning of the summer (chocolate and... whiskey?)&lt;br />&lt;br />When the train left I couldn't contain myself anymore. I had to go sit down, because standing up wasn't a good idea at that point.&lt;br />&lt;br />Later when I was waiting for the bus, I saw the sunrise, and god was it ever beautiful. It was like a big shining smile rising over the horizon. At that moment it felt like someone reassuring me, like it was communicating that all will be fine. It feels a little presumptuous to assume that we would have a sunrise dedicated to us, and nevertheless I feel that that was exactly what it was.&lt;br />&lt;br />Dangit! I'm still crying and it's making it damn hard to see what I type!&lt;br />&lt;br />Ooooooooh GOD I am looking forward to seeing you next time.&lt;br />&lt;br />I wish you well on your Dublin adventures, love. Remember that I believe in you. You're the best. Forever and ever. Amen."},

Simple positions, without  responsibility still require moral decisions.  Even As a bartender w are faced with these types of decisions.  We are told that we can not accept gifts or extensive tips from our customers, yet everyday I see my fellow cast members leaving with flowers and stuffed animals.  That certainly isn't a personal jet used for a lavish vacation, but are we looking at the future person who will abuse power given it?  And how do we positively influence these people?  Is their even hope?  They know what is right and what is wrong, yet they continue to work for their own self interest.  People in society constantly amaze me.  We give power to CEO's and they continue to use their influence and power on board members and others to get what they want.  How can we fix this?  We know what is right and wrong.  We have outlines and definitions of the morals in health care and the conflicts of interest.  We need to avoid hiring people who may put their own interest before that of the company.  But how do we identify these people?  Anyone can get through an interview with all the right answers given the proper research. I guess all we can do is limit power until we gain trust and positively influence others in our work place. "},

I did have a magnolia tree in the backyard which had split near the ground during the storm and half of it was leaning for an hour or so.  Then the wind shifted and the tree righted itself.  It looked OK, but I thought it was probably not really healthy.&lt;br />&lt;br />I also had a pine tree which had been leaning since I moved in in 1990 toward a neighbor's house.  Her house had been damaged by her own pine trees during Katrina and she had all the trees removed.  I decided that I should remove the pine tree and the magnolia.  This left me with more sunshine than ever and some nice piles of wood chips.&lt;br />&lt;br />I thought the wood chips might be good for compost and the extra sunshine might be nice for growing some vegetables.   Now I know that wood chips take a long time to decompose.  Anyway I made a couple of compost bins out of a roll of rabbit cage wire and started composting wood chips mixed with dirt.  I planted some bell peppers, jalepenos, okra, squash and tomatoes.  They ended up being in poor soil and the wood chips were pitiful compost, so they were weak plants.  I misjudged the amount of sunlight in that spot.  I got no squash at all.  I probably got 2 or 3 okra pods, a dozen small bell peppers, a couple dozen small tomatoes and maybe 4 dozen small jalepeno peppers.  My neighbor gave me some cucumber plants and they produced perhaps a dozen cucumbers.&lt;br />&lt;br />My neighbor enjoyed watching me work and helped me out a bit.  He's 90 years old and still gardening.  He kept giving me veggies all summer.   I received more veggies than I grew, but I was happy to have started a relationship with my neighbor and enjoyed his produce.  We had a lot of tomato and cucumber sandwiches.  I started enjoying adding jalepeno to the sandwiches.  The Katrina garden was a little pitiful but I did have some nice food to eat and something positive to do.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&lt;span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">Better Compost&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style=\"font-size: 100%;\">The first section of my garden had been in the area where my older son played basketball.  There was hard packed sandy soil.  Adding wood chips and planting in partial shade was altogether pretty silly.  I started cutting grass and composting grass clippings with some dirt.  After I had some better compost, I started digging a new area for planting.  I chose a little better. The new spot had grass growing and was in the sun.  The dirt looked much better and the compost was better.&lt;br />&lt;br />I planted yellow squash, cucumbers and okra in the second little plot.  I ended up with very large leaves on the squash plants and even had modest success with enough food to make it interesting.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold;\">Fruit Trees&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">&lt;span style=\"font-size: small;\">&lt;span style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\">The wood chips made poor compost for veggies, but I thought that perhaps they would work with trees.&amp;nbsp; I think they work best with \"wild\" type trees and vines.&amp;nbsp; So far it seems that wood chips are great for muscadines.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br style=\"font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;\" />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ph Meter&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-size: 100%;\">&lt;span style=\"font-size: 130%;\">&lt;span style=\"font-size: small;\">I have tried 2 different fairly cheap pH meters in my yard with total failure.&amp;nbsp; I think that I will be forced to guess and over time learn what works in my area.&amp;nbsp; I am fairly convinced that I have acidic soil, so I try to add lime depending on the plant's needs.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>"},

Speaking of fools. I know lots of them. For instance; there was a car accident today at school. This kid who lives up my road (I think he hates my guts...) he probably screeched out of the car park, like most of the drivers try to do and got barrelling down the road off to some unknown restaurant in order to purchase some desired greasy, fatty food for lunch. And then, come storming back to school, in the company of foolish friends and finish up the rest of the day absorbing knowledge like a sponge. Not. It was funnu though because I was walking home for lunch (I like two seconds away) and I heard a tremendous clatter and instantly thought \"Hah, it would be funny if someone went into the ditch.\" Only to hear ten minutes later from my thick as two short plants brother that someone had. Upon my return to school, he was sat on the bonnet of his faded red Jeep Cherokee with a solumn look upon his sunglassed obscured face. Indeed the noon-hour today happened with great incident."},

I guess that in itself is a tribute to the life in the US. I never have enuf time to keep my house and room cuz I am friggin busy keeping busy. ay yay yay.  Theres a couple things I have observed that have been on my mind.&lt;br />&lt;br />BRIDGE! I love Bridge and its goals.  This program at Davis is meant to inspire Filipino students, if not all students, to pursue higher education.  I went to their 10th annual showcase this Saturday cuz my sister said they were inviting past board members.  I haven't been out to anything Bridge in so long so I thought hey, why not.  My sister and Stephen came too...yay one of my best guy friends and former board member.  WE felt old, as expected.  There were too many singing groups, also as expected.  But they were pretty good!  The one thing I was irritated with the whole night was the MC.  The guy MC kept talking about his after party and drinking/getting drunk at the after party, and being \"moist and wet\" from watching the performers.  1) There were parents there.  2) PYC youth were invited (all of high school age)  3) There was even a young performer there age 12 that was watching the show too.  What the hell kind of message are they sending to these kids? It makes it look like Bridge is trying to encourage kids to come to college cus its fun and you get to drink.  What is this? It's one thing for the performers to talk about that stuff, but the MC-- that reflects poorly on Bridge....upsetting.&lt;br />&lt;br />Whew...next more pressing thing.  I have a performance this Sunday.  It's a hula performance and it's making me alil bit nerviosa!  This Sunday, Feb 27  at 12pm at the San Ramon Multicultural Festival.  It should be fun and it's free for all watchers hehe.  So cmon out!  I rarely have nething that I want people to come out n watch...AND it's free woohoo!.  I'm nervous, I just hope I don't get too nervous during the show.  So practice practice practice..whew should be vewy intewesting hehe....gotta go clean some stuff now...whew!"},

I gotta say I do still love my blog, it\u2019s always there for yah even if you\u2019ve neglected it... your few readers however... well the blog is still there though. Plus it doesn\u2019t complain or ask for anything in return... except well id be pretty ticket is some blogger gave me a hideous layout with hearts and black and red font.&lt;br />&lt;br />My neglect comes with a good excuse sickness \u2013 &lt;strong>Tegan and Sara concert&lt;/strong> \u2013 sickness \u2013 sickness. A) people who go shopping when their sick should be shot. The only thing they do is spread their disease around. Working in retail I have to continually wash my hands worried that the countless sick people that into the store during flu season will spread their disease. They fondle the merchandise and peruse the shelves \u2013 do they ever buy anything? no. Why? Because they are sick, they don\u2019t care about decorating their home, they are just so tired of being sick they get bored and think, HEY i\u2019m healthy enough to leave me home... WRONG. You are not, stay at home, get the rest of your family sick, I don\u2019t know you, and I don\u2019t want your germs. So it\u2019s inevitable with my endless hand scrubbing that I would get sick. I would however understand it if they were shopping because they needed to buy a present or some urgent reason why they would leave their homes, but that\u2019s never the case. So to all you sick people who go to movies, and go shopping, or to a restaurant while your sick STOP it you selfish wank.&lt;br />&lt;br />Moving on... &lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\"> &lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\"> &lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\"> &lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\">&lt;strong>&lt;span style=\"font-size:130%;color:#ff0000;\">Tegan and Sara \"Waahoo\"&lt;/span>&lt;/strong>&lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\"> &lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\">&lt;br />&lt;img alt=\"Tegan Quinn\" src=\"http://img30.exs.cx/img30/4844/tegan28dd.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\" /> Last Wednesday was the Tegan and Sara concert at reds. It was fantastic it was the first time I had ever sent hem play live which is amazing because I have admired them since their hit \u201cThe First\u201d got radio play. So Matt and myself trot out our houses around 5pm to go pick up the tickets that we ordered online months ago. When I got there the lady at ticket master said If I would have been a minute later my tickets would have been printed out at Reds, and given away to another customer... kind of a bullshit system if you think about it, and I still doubt that, that would be the case. So with the tickets in hand we headed to West Edmonton Mall only to look at the tickets to see the doors opened at 8pm. Since it was around 5:30 at the time I suggested we waited and went to Matt\u2019s house to kill time there. Instead we went to the Mall thinking it would be better to kill time there... we were wrong. We ate yummy subs and then walked around mindlessly \u2013 since both Matt and I are broke it was a bit tedious. Now I really wish we went to Matt\u2019s house just because walking around and then waiting in line only completely drained us of all energy (damn I\u2019m getting old). We met some friends in line who were there and ahead in line (yes we butted I\u2019m an ass get over it). We only had to wait about 30 minutes in line before they started to let people in. Little did we know reds went through the first 20 people in line and took their tickets ahead of time to stop people from budding sop when we got to the security the guy bumped us to the back of the line. So I was pissed right off, since the lined had progressed about 200 people back. So we waited about 30 more minutes again, by the time we made it back our other friends told us he took the tickets of the people behind us \u2013 so the guy was just having a power trip, and wanted to be an ass. That\u2019s Red\u2019s for yah. &lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\"> &lt;/div>&lt;div align=\"left\">The crowd in reds was pretty diverse, packed with teenage Emo kids and some older people around my age. So by this time I was getting pretty pumped, Reds played clips from America\u2019s Funniest Home Video\u2019s on their big screen while we waited, and finally Lindy came out to play. Now I don\u2019t really understand why some band\u2019s pick the openers they do. By rights an opener should get people pumped, not be too long, but long enough to expose their music and vibe to the crowd, entertain them for the time it takes to do so, and still get them pumped for the show ahead. Lindy did none of these things. There was little stage charisma, and their musical style seemed like wannabe Belle and Sebastian, the band itself spent more time looks at their instruments and the floor than conversing with the crowd. Their set seemed long and drawn out, leaving the crowd to converse with themselves and wonder when their suffering would end. Well, actually that\u2019s been a little harsh; they weren\u2019t horrible they just seemed like one of those bands that would be better via CD. SO by the time they were done, I was completely drained, having been standing for 4 hours now, and being old and sick. It was pretty neat to see both Tegan and Sara come out to watch Lindy play their set. I was so surprised to see how short they both were, which only made them look more cute. Plus you could completely get the vibe that they don\u2019t think their huge celebrities with ego, they had no problem coming out to watch their opener. So once they got on set all my tiredness and aches went away and was replaced with musical bliss. All I have to say is wow. I was so happily surprised at how great they sounded live, even better than they do on album. They seem to be able to play anything from electric guitar to keyboards and acoustic. Both the twins switched in and out during their set between instruments. Reds however has some sound issues and their techies had some mic issues, so the fact that they sounded amazing over all that I was extremely impressed. They carried themselves on stage with perfection. They have immense charisma with their band mates and themselves. Plus they carry and aura towards their fans that they are truly grateful for the support and had mentioned many times throughout the show that, that was indeed the case. Apparently that show was the biggest crowd they had played too that was just them headlining, which I thought was pretty neat. I also thought it was pretty cool when someone yelled out a song request from the crowd and mentioned it was their Birthday, so Tegan got everyone in the crowd to yell happy birthday until she saw everyone yell. Comparing them to other female artists I had seen live they treat each and every fan as if they would treat a friend, they have absolutely no ego, which makes their live shows quite enjoyable. Especially because you don\u2019t need all that crap, you don\u2019t need rehearsed \u201ctalking to the crowd bits\u201d they talked naturally, and once they played you saw their passion for the music which must be so hard to do night after night playing the same songs. They do it in a way that you believe that they make music that they love, and it makes u love it even more. I would love to see what a cd with the production quality that Jennifer Lopez gets staring T&amp;amp;S because their live range was amazing, and it just doesn\u2019t show on their albums.&lt;br />&lt;br />Their set was a mix of new and old, with quite a variety. They also finished the show with a song I had never heard before which was a treat. All in all I give it a 5 star show. not only am I thankful I got the chance to see them live, but also that there is someone out there so talented that actually has a fan base that allows them to make music. They are only going to get bigger and bigger, whether or not they ever make a huge success in the Much Music world. Go see them now. Check out their site for the rest of Canadian tour dates, and get all your friends to go with.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;strong>&lt;a href=\"http://www.teganandsara.com/index.php\">Official Site&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />ps. \u201cI told u so\u201d \u2013 Grammy awards (friggin U2)&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;strong>-J&lt;/strong> &lt;/div>"},

Having done this twice before, I have a better feel for where to go, where not to go, and how to pace my trip.&lt;br />&lt;br />Armed with my trusty laptop, this time around I can blog as I go and give you daily updates - just like a real journalist would!&lt;br />&lt;br />I left Calgary just after 10AM.. After a quick stop in Golden for some lunch, I made it into the Okanagan around 4:00PM local time.. Since it was early enough and it was on the way, I figured I'd stop in at Arrowleaf cellars - a great way to start my trip, being that they're one of my favorite wineries here..&lt;br />&lt;br />I tasted about 5 of the usual suspects:&lt;br />&lt;br />White Feather - their house white blend - a nice quaffable white - not a lot of depth here, but great for patio season.&lt;br />&lt;br />Red Feather - my favorite wine here - their Rose blend - after some sweet-talking, I managed to get my hands on a half a case of the as yet unreleased 2006 vintage (already a silver medal winner) - primarily Pinot Noir and Chardonnay this year.   Looking forward to the hot weather to drink some of this!&lt;br />&lt;br />Chardonnay - a decent Okanagan chard - very little oak, unlike so many of the bottles coming out of California&lt;br />&lt;br />Solstice - their red blend, primarily Merlot and Zweigelt.. I wasn't blown away, but I'm usually not by their reds.  They just seem better at the whites and rose.&lt;br />&lt;br />Vidal (I cant remember the name - its new for them) - it's an off-dry white - the grapes are picked at the same time as the one they use for their late-harvest vidal, so you can guess that the sugar content is pretty high to start with.  I assumed that they fermented it for a bit longer to get the excess sugar out - this seemed to be confirmed by the relatively high 13.6% alcohol content..&lt;br />&lt;br />All in all, I walked out of Arrowleaf with a case of wine for myself and some friends..&lt;br />&lt;br />After Arrowleaf, I headed straight into downtown Kelowna to check into the Royal Anne Hotel - I like this hotel - reasonably priced, and just a block from the waterfront.  And - it's a nice 5 block walk away from...&lt;br />&lt;br />Bouchons Bistro.  Ahhhh...&lt;br />&lt;br />Once again, my love affair with this restaurant has been rekindled for another year.  I walked in a little before 7, and as always, the owner / Maitre'd was out front to greet me - showed me to a table on the patio.  Over the next 90 minutes, I was back in culinary heaven..   I started out with French onion soup simmered with Chablis, paired up with a glass of Alstian Geuwurtztraminer.   Following that was a duo of duck leg confit, with some mushrooms sauteed with pork belly, some seasonable vegetables, and of course the obligatory pommes frites (this is a brasserie style restaurant after all).. I paired that up with a glass of Quail's Gate Reserve Pinot Noir, which worked nicely.   I followed up the main course with a chilled lavendar souflee with passionfruit puree, paired up with a glass of their house sauternes.   Add on an espresso, and I was 'fini'.&lt;br />&lt;br />I followed up that fabulous meal with a trip to the casino.. I think I will now write a book of my experiences, titled \"How to lose at blackjack like a professional\".. Up until tonight, I didn't think it would be possible to lose so much money while holding 19 or 20 in your hand.  Fortunately, the other gents at the table were having similar luck.&lt;br />&lt;br />So, now its time to retire for the evening, and prepare for Day 2.   Saturday is my day to conquer the southern Okanagan, and hopefully squeeze in a couple more good meals to boot.&lt;br />&lt;br />Cheers!"},

Tues Aug 9th, 2005&lt;br />&lt;br />It was a game that the Dazzlers more-or-less needed to win against the first place Panthers. A victory wouldn't guarantee promotion to the next division, but a loss would more-or-less knock it on the head.&lt;br />&lt;br />But the omens weren't great from the beginning: nervous emails flying around in the hours running up to the match;uncharacteristic squabbling out on the field in the first few innings; Isaac cracking his rib just a few days before; the trip down to south London which always seems to send everyone's internal compass doo-lally as soon as they cross the river; plus the Yankees not being able to get a handle on those damn Bosox... it all proved too much, even for a Dazzlers team that arrived early for some pre-game warm-up and practice, riding high on the wave of an exciting win the week before.&lt;br />&lt;br />And so, against the background of sun-kissed young lovers sunbathing and frolicking shamelessly on an unusually beautiful evening as the streaming sunshine blazed through the leaves and onto the rich green grass of Clapham Common, the team took the field to... come to think of it, what the hell were we doing playing softball in the first place???&lt;br />&lt;br />The details aren't important. In fact, it's probably better not to go into them. The mishandled ground balls, the overthrows, the scoreless innings at the plate... whatever. There were some bright spots, like Amy's sizzling liner down the 3rd base line in the top of the 1st; Sam's sky-high tape-measure shot to left field that almost hit the Space Shuttle on its way back down to earth; Rob's fantastic grab in deep, deep right-center field (even if it was obviously only due to the magic little pair of white shoes that he had just put on).&lt;br />&lt;br />Mostly, though, it seems all a blur. And an unfair end to what had been a great season, in an unexpectedly competitive division. But if it is any compensation, it wasn't just that the Dazzlers got beat by a better team. There was a little bit more poetry in it than that. The opposing first-place Panthers were the development team the year before Tony and Gerard put the &lt;br />Dazzlers together. They had that little bit of extra seasoning that the Dazzlers will hopefully pick up next year. They were one year more mature, been round it one extra loop, this was their 3rd stab at it. Their time had come. They were ready to reap the benefits of the hard work they had invested, the experience they had accumulated. I mean, c'mon. they're a great bunch of people and they deserved it, didn't they? Ah, um, didn't they...?&lt;br />&lt;br />Finsbury Dazzlers 3 1 3 0 0 0 1 - 08&lt;br />Sumatra Panthers 8 3 4 6 1 4 x - 26"},

It really is most shameful of me, and I'm sure you won't make do with the excuse that I've been very busy! I will try and remember as much as I can of what has happened since my last post, but those of you who know me well will know that my memory isn't the best in the world, so forgive me if I leave anything out and have to edit the post at a later date!&lt;br />&lt;br />I guess the main bit of news since my last update is that a couple of weeks ago, I was rejected without an interview from the university of my dreams, Oxford. I was absolutely devastated at the time, though I'm beginning to see it in a more philosophical light now. I was at school when I got the news; first thing on a Friday morning, and we'd been let out of English early, so I went to the common room, which thankfully was nearly empty. I got a text from my dad saying that a letter had arrived from Lincoln College, so I phoned him and asked him to open it and read it out to me. Imagine, if you will, how stunned I was when he read out the words:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 255); font-style: italic;font-family:Georgia;\" >\"Unfortunately, in view of the overall competition for places this year and after consultation with other colleges, I am sorry to have to tell you that we shall not be able to offer you a place at Oxford and that your application is no longer under consideration by any of the colleges here.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/span>My initial reaction was to think that it was some kind of awful joke on my dad's part. But no, that would be too cruel. The next thing I did was to burst into tears, run out of the common room, sign out of school ill and wander in a dazed, aimless fashion in the direction of the station (still crying my eyes out and attracting some weird looks from passers-by), to go home. I phoned Alan, who was too shocked to say anything. I didn't stop crying for about an hour and a half. I phoned Jason, who was very supportive and sympathetic and advised me to go out and buy a new pair of shoes, which I did.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"color: rgb(102, 51, 255);\">Change of font colour as it's now over two months since I wrote the above! My lovely Alan is in Japan for *five weeks* and the time difference means that we don't get to talk very much, and thus I have time on my hands and am resurrecting this blog. More on that later, in the meantime I had better update you with what's been going on since that fateful day when I was rejected from Oxford!&lt;br />&lt;br />My teachers did all they could to try and persuade Lincoln College to give me an interview, but alas, to no avail. It was a sad day when we finally had to give up hope, but with hindsight I'm feeling more philosophical about it - in a way, I'm quite relieved that I didn't have to go through the pressure of the infamous Oxford interview, not to mention that if I had got in, I would probably have got very fed up with the amount of work after a while. I'm glad I won't have to go through all that stress, when going to university will be stressful enough as it is.&lt;br />&lt;br />I have had offers from Reading and York, a rejection from Warwick (more on this later!), and I'm still waiting to hear from Durham and Nottingham. My plan initially was to take a year out and reapply to Cambridge, but I've now realised that would be a waste of time, and having been on an open day to Reading University, I've decided to go there. I don't need GCSE Spanish to go there, so I've dropped that and now I get to come home at 11.30am on Thursdays (as opposed to 5.15pm!), which is brilliant! The good thing about Reading is that I can live with Alan whilst doing my degree, which will be excellent. Again, more on this later!&lt;br />&lt;br />The main event since then has been my trip to France over the Christmas holidays. That was quite an experience! Having said goodbye to Alan (always a horrid moment) when he went to France before Christmas, I then joined him in France on December 28, sailing from Portsmouth to St Malo on a cheap overnight crossing. Remarkably, I managed to find my way around the ferry without getting lost, and I met Alan at St Malo the next morning without event. We went to Mt St Michel (I would post photos if I knew how!), a lovely kind of island thing joined to the mainland, with a monastery on top. There was a small street winding round the island leading up to it, and the place had a great atmosphere, like the kind of place you might see on a Christmas card. Unfortunately, my enjoyment of it was hindered slightly by excruciating period pains, and I have a photo of me looking very glum sitting in the main chapel in great pain!&lt;br />&lt;br />That afternoon, we drove back to Alan's parents' place, which is near Vannes in Brittany. I was *so* nervous! I don't speak any French, and they don't speak any English, which just made it worse. I must confess that it took me several days before I started to relax, though there were moments when I was able to be myself a bit more (such as after dinner, when Alan's mum produced loads of Alan's baby photos - sooooo cute! And when Alan's brother, his wife, Alan and I played a kind of board game and I won, even though it was the first time I'd played... don't think Alan was too pleased, as he's played it lots of times but never won!).&lt;br />&lt;br />The food was rather an ordeal! I don't eat that much at the best of times, so faced with meals the size and richness of those, I was not a particularly happy bunny! Perhaps the worst moment for me in terms of food came when a bowl of shrimps arrived on the table. Whole shrimps, with their little eyes staring up at me. The idea was to pull their heads off (gross gross gross!), then peel the legs and shell off, before dipping them in mayonnaise and eating them like that. I was horrified, and looked round to see what everyone else was doing, and they were all tucking into them heartily, so I had no option but to do the same. I found the shells to be very weird, so that I couldn't tell whether they were really hot or really cold... or maybe it wasn't the nature of the shells, maybe it was just me. Anyhow, I was proud of how I handled them, gritting my teeth and bearing it, with bread to help them down. I'm not overly keen to eat them again though, I must say!&lt;br />&lt;br />After staying a couple of days in Vannes, we went to a little village called Binic, on the north coast of Brittany not far from St Malo. This is where Alan's sister and her family live, and where we stayed two nights to celebrate the New Year. The festivities commenced at around 8pm, when we had several courses of food (including more shrimps, alas!) which I thought would never end, culminating in ice cream served with a liqueur which is meant to help you digest quickly so that you can go on eating more! Alan's sister and I didn't have any of that as we don't drink alcohol, but everyone else did. I couldn't believe that! I was relieved, then, when at about 11.30pm we went for a walk to the beach to let off some fireworks. I needed a break from all that eating! The kids were really excited and were being very noisy, and I frankly just wanted to spend some time alone with Alan! We couldn't though, which kind of pissed me off to be honest, but nevermind. After midnight, we went walking round the village, the kids yelling \"bonne ann\u00e9e\" all the way. I thought people would get annoyed with them, but a guy leant out of his window and shouted &lt;/span>&lt;span style=\"color: rgb(102, 51, 255);\">\"bonne ann\u00e9e\" back to us!  It was a great atmosphere, and certainly my most memorable New Year's Night so far.&lt;br />&lt;br />When we got back, it was loud music, the kids going insane dancing to it, and then more food. By this time I was beginning to get really rather pissed off, as I was tired, I'd already eaten far too much food, and I really wanted to be alone with Alan. But no, I had to endure several more courses, and by the time we eventually got to bed at about 3am, I was exhausted and as soon as we were behind closed doors I started crying again, *is ashamed of self*. To add insult to injury, we were sleeping on a horrid old camp bed, which took ages to pump up and then gradually deflated over the next few hours meaning that we had to get up in the middle of the night to pump it up again. Not only that, but every single tiny movement one made produced a massive noise! I think they must have given it to us as some kind of joke!&lt;br />&lt;br />The next day we slept in until about 1pm, which was a source of amusement for Alan's family. I forget how we spent the afternoon, but as some people left I remember beginning to feel a bit more relaxed, and having fun with Alan's nephews and niece. In the evening after the kids had gone to bed, we adults sat down for a meal (yes, more food!!), only for the lights to start switching on and off before finally not coming back on at all! Looking out the window, the entire village appeared to have had the power cut too, so everywhere was pitch black! This was soon followed by the children getting upset, because they were frightened of the dark. Alan's sister and her husband managed to find some candles, and we sat down by candlelight (was actually really quite romantic!) to continue eating. Typically, having spent some minutes lighting all those candles, the electricity returned a couple of minutes later and the lights came back on!&lt;br />&lt;br />The following morning we said goodbye to Alan's sister and her family and started the bit I was really looking forward to - the journey to Paris. Six hours or so of time spent just the two of us! On the way there, we drove through Versailles, which was absolutely awesome! It was dark by the time we got there, and the palace was lit up and looked fabulous - I definitely want to go back for a proper visit some day! The streets were all lit with Christmas lights, and it looked wonderful.&lt;br />&lt;br />We arrived at Alan's brother's house a little later that evening, and I liked it because it was a lot quieter following the noise of Alan's sister's kids (though don't get me wrong, they were great - just in moderation!)! We spent those last two days in Paris, which is the best city I've ever been to (but I agree, I've not visited that many!). We saw lots of very famous places, and I was ashamed of myself for acting like a tourist and getting all excited over seeing the Eiffel Tower for the first time! We went right to the top, and the view was breathtaking! We then went to the top of the Arc de Triumph, which was considerably harder work than the lifts which take one to the top of the Eiffel Tower - it was a spiral staircase, which seemed to go up, and up, and up forever! I had the misfortune of having hiccups all the way up too, so there was me out of breath and the sound of my hiccups resonating through the stairwell thanks to the stone walls and floor! However, the struggle up those stairs was worth it for the spectacular view of Paris by night, including the Eiffel Tower lit up! It was really wonderful, and I didn't want to leave!&lt;br />&lt;br />Other places we went to in Paris included Montmatre, which had an amazing atmostphere, what with the guy sitting playing the harp (gave the place such an air of culture!) and all the artists waiting to paint/draw people's portraits. The view of Paris from there was spectacular, too. We went round Notre Dame cathedral, which was also very impressive, as well as seeing the Moulin Rouge (from the outside). The street which the Moulin Rouge is on is extremely dodgy, as it is lined with sex shops - more than I've ever seen in my life! (ok, confession time... I don't think I'd ever seen a sex shop before then! :-0) I actually felt quite scared to be there after dark (we had to so that we could take photos of the Moulin Rouge when it's all lit up... though we took some pics of the sex shops too, just because there were so many!)!&lt;br />&lt;br />I'm sure there are other things I meant to write about Paris - it was certainly a packed couple of days! I loved Paris and didn't want to leave - two days weren't long enough, that's for sure! I hope to go back some day, though in the meantime there are many, many other places I'd like to visit, so I won't waste time by revisiting somewhere I've already been for now! We managed to get an earlier ferry home to England, sailing from Calais, though it was in the middle of the night and the ferries were running late due to adverse weather conditions. Once on board, we headed for one of the lounges, where having had a cup of hot chocolate Alan went to sleep, and I was left not really knowing what to do, as I hadn't thought of bringing a book, and I'm not fortunate enough to be able to sleep whenever and wherever I want! I had a look round some of the shops on the ferry, and made the mistake of trying on some perfumes. Why was this a mistake, I hear you ask? I'm sure it would have been fine had it been the daytime (ie, had I been able to see outside so that I could see the motion of the ship), but as it was the middle of the night I couldn't see the horizon, and whilst initially the up and down movement of the ship thanks to the rough sea was fairly exciting, the novelty soon wore off and I began to feel very sick. The heady smell of the perfume just made me feel ten times worse, and as soon as we were back in the car, I washed it off with bottled water! I shan't be making that mistake again!&lt;br />&lt;br />My overall feelings about the trip were good: it was quite an experience, and there were some very memorable moments. I did wish on many occasions, however, that I had been able to spend more time alone with Alan, as we did in Cornwall. It was great to meet his family at last, despite the communication problems, but given the choice I would certainly have opted for a holiday for just the two of us! We are planning on going to Italy over the summer, which I'm greatly looking forward to. I really want to see the world!&lt;br />&lt;br />I had better say a few words about one or two things which happened before I left for France! My dad took my friend Hannah and me to see Handel's Messiah in Bath just before Christmas, which we both enjoyed greatly. It was nice to see so many people I know (including the evil guy I dated a few times a couple of years ago, Nathan; though he was pretty charming on that particular occasion), in particular Jason (who was conducting) and my best friend from choir, Claire. I loved the music, and it was nice to go to a concert as a member of the audience for a change!&lt;br />&lt;br />The end of term at school didn't really feel like the end of term, and was distinctly lacking in the Christmas spirit which had been such a feature of the previous year. This was because our sadistic headteacher banned anything to do with Christmas, even down to tinsel in the hair, even on the very last day of term. He also limited the number of carols sung in the end of term assembly to one (Hark the Herald Angels Sing, a nice religious one), which was not met with popular approval. I played in the band and happily occupied the role of principal flute, a pleasant improvement on last year when my arch nemesis Katherine took on the role. The day after the end of term my friends and I went to Gill's 18th birthday party, which was basically just a pizza and video evening and swapping Christmas presents. I didn't enjoy it much, as I never really enjoy being in groups of more than three or four people. I find it intimidating!&lt;br />&lt;br />Corsley Choir is going well. Our concert at the beginning of December seemed to be a success, though I must admit I found the repertoire rather boring. Natalie came to the concert, and I introduced her to the famous John. I was in turn introduced to John's wife and John's wife's mother, and I found that his wife was really nice! I've since come to the conclusion that John seems more of a family man than he likes to make out sometimes, and he's finally learnt to kiss me on the cheek and not on the lips. So good progress there! We are now singing the Mozart Requiem (and will be singing the Ave Verum too), which I'm really excited about. I'm finding it harder than I expected, but I love the music so much that I don't find that problematic in the slightest! I have also been getting on well with Jason recently, although Rachel has had to tell him off for being too sarcastic with me (he claims I find it funny because I always laugh, which sadly is true... he is funny!)!&lt;br />&lt;br />I suppose the most major event before France was Christmas, which was enjoyable (though I would have liked to have been with Alan on Christmas Day, but nevermind! I hopefully will be this year!). My uncle Michael came on the day as he usually does, so that was fun. We went for a nice walk with the dog and took lots of photos, and in the evening watched a film (I can't remember what it was we watched!). On Boxing Day some old neighbours of ours came for lunch, which is something they always do and something which I personally find rather a bore.&lt;br />&lt;br />A notable absence from the Christmas festivities was my grandparents. This is because we are unfortunately no longer on good terms with them. Entirely their choice, and sparked off by events which began with the death of my great grandmother. My mum and I represented our part of the family at the funeral in November, and while we were there we met lots of relatives (many of whom I never knew existed) with whom we decided we would like to remain in contact. This appeared to be Grandad's intention too, for the relatives in question are his brothers (my great uncles), who have been estranged for many years for various reasons too complicated to go into. To cut a long story short, Nanny had other ideas, and very soon she had taken offence at my mum wanting to be on friendly terms with Grandad's brothers, and announced that they would not be spending Christmas with us, which they have done for as long as I can remember. Since then things have escalated, and they've announced that they're not going to speak to us again, which I frankly find ridiculous and hurtful. I never expected to fall out with them, and it's a great pity. They seem determined not to listen to any talk from us of reconciliation, and it seems that they have made their minds up and there is nothing we can do about it. So that's that! :-(&lt;br />&lt;br />January was very busy, what with revising for my geography resit exam. I spent a free period with Mrs Hand, who very kindly gave me a file and organised all my geography notes for me, so that I knew which ones I had to revise from (otherwise I'd have wasted time revising for stuff which wouldn't come up on the paper!). In the end, I don't know how the exam went - one never can tell! - but I'm not too bothered about it because I still got a B overall, and if it's any worse than last time I don't need to take the grade, I can keep the first one. At the end of January I went to Warwick University for an interview, which went disasterously. I didn't like the interviewer and she (why couldn't it have been a guy, they're so much easier to talk to!) clearly didn't like me, and asked lots of questions which didn't leave much scope for very stimulating replies, not to mention that she asked me about a book I'd mentioned in my personal statement which I hadn't finished reading, so I couldn't talk about it at all because she was asking about the ending. All in all it was a disaster, and I ended up disliking the university as a whole owing to that unpleasant experience. I didn't stay for the sample lectures, I just went straight home! As predicted I was rejected, and it's just a good job I didn't want to go there!&lt;br />&lt;br />My job at the cafe I mentioned is going well. I'm still doing it, remarkably (I've been wanting to leave), though I do find it very hard work and stressful. It's rather making me appreciate Longleat! Incidentally, I did get that bonus I spoke of in my last entry! \u00a3108! They also paid me \u00a3120 of holiday pay, so that was great - it worked out really well in the end! My mum applied for a job there this year, but sadly didn't get the job because there were an incredible thirty applicants just for six places! I don't think it can have been that competitive last year, when I was applying for the job, otherwise I doubt I would have got the job.&lt;br />&lt;br />At the beginning of this month (February) I had my A level recital, which was traumatic. I played the Telemann Viola Concerto, Glasunow \"Elegie\" (also for viola) and \"Idylle\" by Benjamin Godard (for flute), and Gerry, the guy who accompanies Corsley Choir, accompanied me, which was great as I get on very well with him. The recital could have gone worse, but it could also have gone a lot better. My viola playing really let me down, and the question on everyone's lips after the recital was why didn't I do the whole recital on the flute! The answer being that I was advised by people who know better than me about these things not to do the recital on the flute, since I no longer have lessons. Let's face it, I hadn't played the flute properly for over a year, and yet my playing was still infinitely superior to my viola playing, despite having lessons most weeks. I have no decided I'm going to do the recital again, but entirely on the flute, and I'm having a flute lesson with Jonathan as a birthday present from my parents (it's horrendously expensive) in order to help me prepare. I'm quite excited about that!&lt;br />&lt;br />The state of my health has been somewhat less exciting. My cough having returned, I began to experience a shortness of breath about which I went to see the doctor and was then diagnosed with some kind of asthma. I now have to have an inhaler, which is a pain, and some time in the next few days I will be having to go to the hospital to have a chest x-ray, which is annoying. I just hope it doesn't reveal anything potentially nasty!&lt;br />&lt;br />It was half term last week and I spent the week with Alan, naturally. I went to his place on Friday night, but unfortunately came down with a really severe fever, and spent the whole of the next day and much of Sunday as well in bed. On Monday it was Valentine's Day, and Alan and I went to collect the gorgeous ring he has bought me, which was very exciting! It's a pink sapphire gem with a diamond either side, and I'm still captivated by the way it sparkles in the light! In the afternoon, we dressed up in smart clothes (he looked absolutely gorgeous in his suit.... I felt so proud to be with him!) and set off somewhere (I didn't, at that point, know where we were going!). It turned out that we were going to London, to a Valentine's concert given by the London Concert Orchestra at the Barbican Hall! It was tremendously exciting, although I got very cold on the streets of London and my shoes weren't the most comfortable in the world! It was worth it though, and it was a super evening. We even made it back to Oxford in time to go to Domino's Pizza before it closed at midnight, hurrah!&lt;br />&lt;br />The rest of the week, Alan had to be at work during the day, so I worked on my coursework back in his room, which was boring and claustrophobic, but worth it to be able to spend the evenings and nights together. I can assure you, however, that you do *not* want to get me started on the subject of his landlady, so I shall say no more about her than that. Last Wednesday, we went to look at an apartment in Abingdon, just south of Oxford, and decided very quickly that it's the place for us, so we've reserved it! It's so exciting! It's a really nice top floor apartment with a great kitchen, and we'll be moving into it when it becomes available in May (though I won't be able to live there until the end of May when I go on study leave, but it's only a few weeks!). I shall then be commuting from Abingdon to Reading when I'm at university. It's all happening at the moment! :-D&lt;br />&lt;br />Except that technically, it's not all happening, since Alan is in Japan for five weeks. He left on Saturday and won't be back until March 27th (when I will be meeting him at Heathrow), which, though exciting for him, is almost unbearable for me because we hardly get to talk at all because of the time difference (Japan is nine hours ahead) and because he only gets internet access when he's at work. I can't believe it's going to be so long before I see him again... in fact, it seems like an eternity. I've felt really depressed over the last few days, and I didn't expect to find this so difficult to cope with. I think I'm beginning to come to terms with it, but the prospect of the next few weeks seems frightfully gloomy (in particular when he leaves Kyoto and will only have internet access sporadically... his phone doesn't work in Japan, so we'll be totally without means of communication). *sigh* It's really testing me to the limits, and on top of everything else I'm kind of jealous that he gets to travel to so many interesting places.... I just really hope I will be as lucky some day.&lt;br />&lt;br />It has been snowing here a lot today, and BBC News Online (a site to which I've been addicted since Alan left because I've got nothing else to do) informs me that the worst is yet to come. I really crave somewhere warm at the moment, or at the very least I crave the arrival of summer!&lt;br />&lt;br />I shall sign off here, for this entry is now ridiculously long; congratulations if you have made it this far! I'll try and update again soon.&lt;br />&lt;/span>"},

Lots of fun and I wont even try to review it here. But what is it missing, multiplayer? Well no, the genius behind Oblivion is the very nature of the single player experience. But after playing World of Warcraft and getting used to being *part* of a community thats what I really miss. Playing Oblivion feels lonely.&lt;br />&lt;br />Has WoW ruined single player games for me? Has the feeling of belonging to a Guild ruined the enjoyment of a lone experience? And solo questing doesnt count as a truly lone experience - I'd estimate that a very large percentage of all inter-personal interaction between players on WoW is not directly related to the quest or adventure being played by the people chatting away. People chat about how to beat a mob, or how cool your latest gear is, perhaps discuss raid tactics or your latest spec lists. Often the conversation mutates into interesting but nonetheless unrelated topics such as your latest gadgets, where you're going on holiday or what your favourite artist is up to. Thats the thing - its a community&lt;br />&lt;br />Perhaps WoW has ruined single player games. But how about this - introduce the feeling of an online community into the existing Oblivion game using a 'chat' mod. Imagine playing Oblivion but having access to a similiar type of chat function as in WoW. Form and join guilds, interact online with friends while playing Oblivion, get tips on the quests and the world....think of it as WoW but in a very large 1 player instance.&lt;br />&lt;br />I reckon that would be fun, and if some intrepid developer comes up with the mod, I'll pay a dollar for it!&lt;br />&lt;/span>"},

Given my inability to see a piece of paper, or napkin without writing on it, we naturally had an impromptu handwriting analysis session. Which really blew because I couldn't remember how to analyse jack ;) But I hunted up the original analysis test and re-did it (today). Is it still disgustingly accurate? You bet! Joycie and Abs were wondering about the scientific accuracy of these things, and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot, but here's some useful sites. &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphology\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia's take on things&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href=\"http://myhandwriting.com/FAQ/\" target=\"_blank\">FAQ&lt;/a> from the place I did the analysis from.

Investigates things rapidly b/c of intense curiosity. Extremely logical and ordered way of thinking. Takes on way too many projects at a time. Diplomacy is a strong suit; has the ability to say what others want to hear, tells things straight without offending and can disagree without being disagreeable.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;strong>My 'O's:&lt;/strong> Is highly opinionated and will be candid and direct when exrpressing opinions.

Is an introvert who makes decisions based on logic, therefore is rarely impulsive. Doesn't find any need for expressing emotions and sees this as an unnecessary waste of time. Many people do not understand and it is difficult for them to really know how she feels. Enjoys being alone, and prefers working alone. Working with her hands is a pleasure. Does feel emotions, as deeply as anyone else, but they're harboured inside. The first time someone angers her, she probably will not say anything to that person. However, she will mentally keep track of everything this person does wrong to her until she cannot hold her emotions inside any longer. Then, Boom! Will never regret telling someone off, because she knew what she was saying the entire time. She won't impulsively tell someone off. Emotional stories will not sway her. Thinks totally with judgment, first considering every situation by the effect it will have on her. Needs space and time alone. &lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;strong>My 'K's:&lt;/strong> Can be defiant. Sometimes has the attitude that if someone doesn't like it the way she is doing it, then they can just \"go to hell!\" This trait may reveal itself in a rebellious nature that is always ready to resist forces which she thinks are infringing upon her freedom of action.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">Are you all believers now?! *shudder* That whole thing was disturbingly accurate. Other than the diplomacy thing of course ;) Go do the test and tell me what your results are!&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">&lt;strong>&lt;em>Well, if you're still here after all of the above lol, check back in a little bit, maybe towards the middle of next week for pictures and other scintillating things from my trip to Montreal!&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>"},

I'm a 33 yr. old man, divorced for 4 years with 2 daughters ages 12 and 6 and i'm going to attempt to chronicle my life as a single man to shed a little bit of insight to my newly found life as an extremely sexy, single guy. The first thing that you have to learn as a single guy is how to deal with alcoholism.. not really the destructive stumbling falling down drunkeness, but the daily drinking that seems to come naturally with being a single male.  you see, after spending your day at work, you come home to an empty house on the nights that you don't have your kids around and you have two choices..either make yourself dinner which causes dirty dishes and trash, or go to the bar and get a sandwich and a beer.. well, obviously the latter choice results in becoming a much better pool player and obtaining your very own beer gut.. these things i've found are much easier to get than a decent woman but not nearly as pleasurable... so after a couple years of experimenting with this behavior you decide on an alternative, which for me included joining a gym and making deals with yourself to get along without ending up looking like that guy down the street that you can't for the life of you understand what his motivation to live is. (see the complete and runon sentence thing is already a problem) so you make a pact with yourself to not drink monday thru thursday and make it to the gym every morning at 5:30 a.m. to get your workout in before work, eat right, work on basketball, boxing, and golf skills at lunch time, and generally be the guy that every married woman on the planet would rather have than their husband, and still be able to not get one single (single) woman interested in you. so here's were we're at in my first blogamadiggy.. i have great days because i'm physically fit, controlled my demons, enjoy my time with my children, and can do virtually anything that i want to do.. and at the same time have no good outlook on ever having a positive relationship because of the comfort level that i've found within myself.  so now the real story starts, how does a man find a woman he can have a relationship with when he has made himself so independant and in all reality the perfect man? well, the answer of course is that he can't so that's why these weblogs will continue for quite some time and i plan to log my dating experiences, both horrible and notsohorrible for your reading pleasure.  the first thing i had to deal with is the fact that even at 33 years of age i had never asked a girl out face to face.. this is a serious problem for someone like me, i was fixed up with my wife through a friend, and fixed up with my last serious girlfriend through my ex-wife so i've really never been single or had to ever ask a female out before.. so i needed some guidance, that's where the internet comes in handy.. you see, there is no need for things like eye contact, nice cloths, good breath to chat with strangers on the internet.. where in real life this can be both challenging and terrifying, online you have the ability to treat everyone like the girl on the playground you used to torment. so that's how i get my start in this whole singles thing and thanks to aol groups, you can simultaniously e-mail everyone in a group with one stupid comment like \"why is it so damn funny when you see someone slip on ice and fall flat on their ass?\" well, needless to say, this comment caused several reactions with our more sensitive of the female gender, and i got called all sorts of unapropriate things.. but it also gave me a chance to privately e-mail all of these ladies back and looking back i actually made a friend out of the deal (and got some much needed casual sex from another).. i've lost my train of thought and must go play mindless computer games now, this blog will continue as long as i'm single so sign up for your 4 year subscription now while quantities last! ..peace. d"},

I have been struggling with Lust. I thought I would look it up in my Thompson Chain Reference Bible (topic 667) and here are the verses they listed (all of these are from the King James Version--not copyrighted).&lt;br />&lt;br />Proverbs 6:25 &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. &lt;/span>This is interesting, because Solomon says there is a two-way relationship: we lust, and she takes. This gives us two opportunities to stop the cycle.&lt;br />&lt;br />Matthew 5:28 &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.&lt;/span> And we thought we were better because we didn't actually DO something, just thought or saw it.&lt;br />&lt;br />Romans 13:4 &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.&lt;/span> Not pretty to hear, but eventually we could be judged for our wrongs.&lt;br />&lt;br />Galatians 5:16 &lt;span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. &lt;/span>A solution, keep reading the Bible and praying and stay in the Spirit and we can conquer sin. It has been conquered for us if we simply claim the victory in Jesus.&lt;br />&lt;br />Colossians 3:5 &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:&lt;/span>&lt;br />concupiscence (def) A strong desire, especially sexual desire; lust.  Mortify means put to death, if I am correct.  Do not even give it a CHANCE to live, or continue.&lt;br />&lt;br />1 Thessalonians 4:5 &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />2 Timothy 2:22 &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&lt;/span>  Keep good company.&lt;br />&lt;br />James 1:15 &lt;span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.&lt;/span>  The pleasure of sin is temporary, and it puts you in a downward spiral towards death.  Maybe not &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic;\">always &lt;/span>Physical death but definitely a spiritual death.  It leaves us alienated from the Father, unable to hear His voice.  Of course, in this day and age, physical death can be associated with lust.&lt;br />&lt;br />1 Peter 2:11 &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;&lt;/span>  He is calling them \"beloved\" even though they may be involved with fleshly lusts.  This shows the love of God for even \"strangers and pilgrims.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />Out of nine verses, one talks about judgement, and another one about the consequences of sin and lust.  This tells me how loving God is, that in this area where we struggle there is instruction and encouragement, rather than death and destruction.  Which is what we like to say to others, but never want it to apply to ourselves."},

Im really thankful to Denny now, he told me honestly and straight why people have a problem with me. I hope itll end my confidence being below zero, i hated walking into a room and feeling everyone hated me, watching people leave and thinking its cause of me. I felt it most with Ben, Bens a guy i really kinda admire...is admire the right word?um..i hold him in high esteem, and i could see the way he acted towards me changing and it was horrible, i wouldve give my right arm to make things the way they used to be with him.  Id give anything to go back and change alot of things thats been happening but all i can do is learn from it and make sure the futures different.

I think mostly, because I have a bunch of things I want to talk about. I sort of like the idea of writing a tiny journal entry like how Papa did, about things he'd been thinking about. I miss Daddy very, very much right now. I sort of want to send him an e-mail, too.&lt;br />&lt;br />I think that it's rather neat, how Daddy's and my schedules work right now. Especially Wednesdays, I think that it's neat that Papa has Wednesday off, to be with Ojii-sama, on the day that I have class almost all day long. I think that it works super well that way, and is really convenient for both of us.&lt;br />&lt;br />I feel very amused, because I just tried the \"grapples\" that I picked out at the store. They were a bit disappointing, though. They smelled super much like grapes, but only tasted a little bit like them, and more like apples instead. I didn't like them particularly much, since I don't like grape very much, but it was super, super interesting to get to try them anyway. I wonder if there is a website about them, too.&lt;br />&lt;br />I still feel very much overwhelmed about Ragnarok Online. I like the idea of playing it with Daddy very, very much, though. I think that it will be really fun to get to be Papa's little acolyte. I hope super much, that we won't spend all of our time together playing it, though. I still want to be able to spend time with Papa on AIM, just chatting and snuggling and doing other fun things, and not just playing RO with him.&lt;br />&lt;br />I really didn't like the argument Papa and I had about it, and Kristi today. I really do dislike the idea of having Kristi know very much about me. I think that one of the reasons I dislike the idea so much, is because of some of the comments she's made about BDSM before. She didn't want Ellie to be named Electra, because she thought that it sounded like a name a dominatrix would have. She also got very upset when one of her friends called her that, before too.&lt;br />&lt;br />I feel really odd about the idea of being a little boy for Papa right now. I feel sort of like I've lost the ability to be a little boy for him anymore, really. I like the idea of it still, though. It really helped that Daddy let me be a little boy with him when I got so upset today. Daddy is right, that being a little boy makes it a whole bunch easier to deal with scary or upsetting things. I want to be a little boy for him more often, though. I want to play games with my Daddy, and to do colorings for him.&lt;br />&lt;br />Class today was a bit more interesting than usual, in that we talked a bit about what the different parts of an argument were, and how to tell if something said was just repeating another point the person made. I really like the idea of picking apart the arguments people make.&lt;br />&lt;br />It was very odd when I needed to go to the bathroom during the break we were given tonight, though. I had to wait, which I think is horribly embarrassing and annoying; a middle aged woman came in after me, and then opened the door back up to check the sign on it. I thought that it was so, so funny that she did that. I wanted to laugh very much, but I think that it's good that I didn't.&lt;br />&lt;br />I've really, really liked that Daddy and I have been more sexual lately. I really love being called Papa's little bitch, whore and slut. I like feeling embarrassed, and blushing so, so brightly. I like how it feels when I blush bright red, usually. I really like thinking about Papa dressing me up in revealing outfits, and having me do embarrassing things for him. I liked it very much, when Daddy called me his little \"kitten slut\" in the scene we started a bit ago. I love being so, so submissive to Papa sexually so much."},

Todos sabem que, a princ\u00edpio, esse seria pr\u00e1 ser um di\u00e1rio... Um confidente... E, ele acabou se tornando um amigo nas horas mais dif\u00edceis enquanto eu estava apaixonada e passando por maus bocados por n\u00e3o ser correspondida... Escutando meus lamentos, dividindo minhas felicidades, me dando o ombro pr\u00e1 chorar...&lt;br />&lt;br />Estava triste, estava magoada... E decidi que n\u00e3o escreveria mais enquanto estivesse assim... N\u00e3o queria (e nem quero) a pena de ningu\u00e9m... S\u00f3 quero ser forte e voltar a ter aquela for\u00e7a que eu tinha h\u00e1 algum tempo... Uma for\u00e7a que me permitia ag\u00fcentar o mundo nas costas... Uma for\u00e7a que me deixava invulner\u00e1vel a toda forma de amor. Por isso, resolvi deixar o tempo passar...&lt;br />&lt;br />E o tempo passou...&lt;br />&lt;br />Dizem que o tempo \u00e9 o grande mestre que cura todas as feridas...&lt;br />&lt;br />A verdade \u00e9 que ele n\u00e3o cura!&lt;br />&lt;br />A verdade \u00e9 que, quando amamos de verdade uma pessoa, esse sentimento vai nos acompanhar por toda a vida... A \u00fanica coisa que o tempo nos permite fazer \u00e9 varrer esse sentimento pr\u00e1 um cantinho escondido bem no fundo de nossas almas para que, pelo menos \u00e0s vezes, possamos fazer de conta que ele n\u00e3o est\u00e1 l\u00e1 e, mesmo assim, quando vemos uma imagem ou escutamos uma m\u00fasica ou nos aproximamos de datas especiais, esse sentimento volta \u00e0 tona nos pegando de surpresa e nos arrastando pro fundo do po\u00e7o mais uma vez.&lt;br />&lt;br />Isso aconteceu de novo na p\u00e1scoa... Tantos planos... Tanta coisa boa planejada... Tanta coisa boa sonhada... Mas eu estava longe... E meu amor, vivendo uma nova paix\u00e3o.&lt;br />&lt;br />E, novamente, decidi que era hora de deixar o tempo passar...&lt;br />&lt;br />E o tempo, novamente passou...&lt;br />&lt;br />O mundo n\u00e3o parou para que eu pudesse lamber minhas feridas, deix\u00e1-las cicatrizar e olhar orgulhosa para as cicatrizes das batalhas que travei sozinha.&lt;br />&lt;br />Ent\u00e3o pessoas...&lt;br />&lt;br />Venho aqui hoje me despedir desse blog... Venho aqui trazendo meu amor nas m\u00e3os, como se fosse um passarinho e libertando-o, deixando que ele voe e alcance os c\u00e9us e a felicidade que um dia tentei dar... A felicidade que, por muito e muito tempo tentei, desesperadamente participar.&lt;br />&lt;br />Ent\u00e3o \u00e9 isso...&lt;br />&lt;br />F\u00e1...

Nah, just kidding. But i &lt;em>DO&lt;/em> think it had to do with some kinda \"non-alcoholic\" drink my friend gave me last night.  (thats the truth)  Good thing Im never plannin on drinkin the real stuff. I wouldnt be able to handle it very well i have a feeling. But newho, I got a quick shower (which prolly is equal to 3 or 4 averagely-timed showers)for me, and then i headed off to my church. My dad let me drive. I only have my permit.  and a good thing too, cuz you prolly wouldnt want me to be reigning the roads at the same time as yourself.  im perty bad at the skill so far.  I forgot to signal all of my turns on the drive over to the church and i was in la-la land. Couldnt even park straight.  But i made it there safely.  Then i headed off with my youth group to our church camp for \"Mud Day\".  I bet you'll never guess wut we all did--oh shoot. Youre smart. Yea, thats right; we played in the mud.  The ppls had filled a dirt pit with water and then we all hopped on in. It was a bit chilly, but hey, its not every day one is allowed to flop around in some fresh mud. So I hardly minded the temperature.  After we rinsed off, we headed back home. I listened to \"Barlow Girls\" the entire ride back.  Then i got a shower.  Now im sittin here.  Crazy, huh?  Alright, i feel like crap. And im tired if typing. Besides, who would wanna talk to &lt;em>&lt;strong>you&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> anways?  im outtie. peace."},

As I made my turn north, I noticed a car facing south, and the woman in the driver seat was sticking her middle finger up at me. She was looking right at me, and I lipread her yelling A#*hole.  I made my turn, and parked on the side of the road (because we don't have an employee parking lot...)and thought, 'huh, what a psycho.' It dawned on me about a block into my walk to work (I had to park 3.5 blocks away because the city street cleaning is today and tomorrow, so there is no parking on the street where I work) that I didn't have my turn signal on. That's why she freaked out. But, in my defense I was all the way over to the farthest side of the street (where cars park) and approached the corner where I turned slowly. So, it's not like I did a Speedracer maneuver and cut her off at the last minute. What a psycho. When I was only a half a block away I remembered something I left in my car that I needed. So I had to turn back around and retrieve it. I was only a few feet from my car when suddenly a car stopped (screeching it's tires) and a woman's voice shouted out, \"It's people like you that kill innocent people! You're an ignorant person, and a horrible driver!!!\", and then she sped off. Did she double back just to say that to me? I stood dumbfounded, bewildered even. I had no choice but to shrug it off, what was I going to do? Start shouting back at no one? I got the thing I forgot out of my car, and made way back to work. A homeless man greeted me at the corner and asked me for a smoke, and when I said don't got it, he asked me for a dollar. I told him I had nothing, and he called me a crazy slut. I was about 1 block away from work, and I saw James Brown, aka \"The Beast\" (you know from my previous post, this is my co-worker who wears James Brown style wigs, and I LOATHE HER.) &lt;br />So I see James Brown, and I thought to myself, \"This is a perfect way to top off a crappy start.\" I looked over to her and smiled politely. She started to yell something over to me. \"What's that?\"  I said, as I could barely hear her. \"I say-ed, you best not be parked in the parking lot!

I do believe that John Waverly did perform unethically. As a CEO he should be more professional and not involve his personal prefaces into his work life. Since John is a married man, his motive portrays to be even more unethical. The sexual harassment in this case occurred when the postgraduate was not offered a job. John focused on his attraction to her rather that on a job opportunity. The postgraduate had every right to believe that this was a sexual harassment issue and the proper board members needed to be notified. If a physical relationship had already developed prior to the confrontation, then I feel that it would not be a sexual harassment case. In this situation there was no physical relationship, just a strong work friendly partnership. John violated the Code Of Ethics and he has to face the consequences. Overall, sexual harassment is a major violation and can come in different forms. These forms include physical, verbal, and emotional. John's verbal discussion of his attraction to the postgraduate, to me falls in to the category of sexual harassment. "},

This graph from &lt;span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">peakoil.net&lt;/span> shows the discovery data superimposed on to the production data.&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://www.peakoil.net/uhdsg/weo2004/FSU.jpg\" width=\"420\"/>&lt;br />I transcribed the data from the chart (ignoring the extrapolated data) and used the general model source code.&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://img335.imageshack.us/img335/8573/fsuprod1tr.gif\"/>&lt;br />I used a mean value of 5 years for each of the &lt;i>fallow&lt;/i>, &lt;i>build&lt;/i>, and &lt;i>maturation&lt;/i> phases. This came out shorter than the 8 year latencies that I chose for the &lt;a href=\"http://mobjectivist.blogspot.com/2005/10/shock-model-with-aspo-discovery-data.html\">global&lt;/a> and &lt;a href=\"http://mobjectivist.blogspot.com/2005/10/shock-model-applied-to-usa-lower-48.html\">USA-48&lt;/a> model. &lt;br />&lt;br />The green curve assumes a proportional extraction rate of 0.09/year (&lt;i>1/e&lt;/i> time of about 11 years).  This follows the production curve up until about the time of political instability in the Soviet Union. After that point, c.1984, I added perturbations according to the following chart, leading to the red curve which overlays the production data points.&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://img335.imageshack.us/img335/5779/fsuperturb9pw.gif\"/>&lt;br />&lt;a href=\"http://mobjectivist.blogspot.com/2005/10/hubbert-did-in-soviet-union.html\">&lt;/a>&lt;br />The glitch occurring after 1984 looks benign but evidently carried some punch -- according to some interesting remarks I found previously, Reagan had a hand in it:&lt;a href=\"http://mobjectivist.blogspot.com/2005/10/hubbert-did-in-soviet-union.html\">&lt;blockquote>It seems likely that the Reagan administration, which took office in 1981, bearing in mind the economic havoc produced when US production peaked in 1981, followed by the Arab oil embargo and the \"oil crisis\" of 1973-74 and the deep recession that followed, decided to use the \"oil weapon\" to destabilize the USSR. Reagan embarked on a major military buildup, putting the Soviet Union under pressure to keep up. Meanwhile, declining prices after 1981 forced the USSR to pump more oil to supply its clients in Eastern Europe and to sell in world markets for hard currency. Then in 1985 Reagan persuaded Saudi Arabia to flood the world markets with cheap oil. Again, the USSR had to increase output to earn hard currency. This led to the second peak in 1988.&lt;/blockquote>&lt;/a> I see a more of a dip followed by a recovery rather than a strict oil production increase, which I imagine could result from a lagged reaction to market forces. The Soviets had no choice but to shut down their pumps temporarily -- they did not have the technology or reserves to increase production beyond what the big red Soviet machine could already provide. By the time 1988 arrived, it became too late for them to do anything about it, as the eastern bloc started to implode.&lt;br />&lt;br />The post-Soviet transition shows a severe reduction in extraction rates. Clearly, the new FSU republics no longer had to produce oil to continue militarizing their bloc countries and allies (including Cuba). True free-market forces replaced the fixed demand and the new capitalists also had their eye on the green curve (peak oil in 1990). Much like the USA after our peak in 1970, they likely wanted to modulate the supply.&lt;br />&lt;br />So what explains the reverse shock (i.e. sudden extraction increase) in the last few years? Note that the BP data also &lt;a href=\"http://mobjectivist.blogspot.com/2005/10/mind-is-terrible-thing-to-decline.html\">shows this FSU oil production increase&lt;/a>. I don't know why, but OPEC production hasn't really gone up much over the past few years, and the FSU clearly has, or at least had the production capacity during the Soviet era. I would imagine that &lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;\">somebody&lt;/span> has to make up the potentially widening supply &amp; demand gap.  &lt;br />&lt;br />The model shows that at the current proportional extraction rate, the FSU has probably hit its secondary oil peak. They can conceivably try to keep on increasing the extraction rate (seeing as they do have that Soviet-era spare capacity, &lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;\">unless, of course,&lt;/span> it all got sold by Russian scrap-iron merchants in the ensuing years).  But remember, the law of extraction: the steeper the hill, the faster the decline post-peak.&lt;br />&lt;br />Thanks to &lt;a href=\"http://peakenergy.blogspot.com/2005/10/peak-sightings.html#comments\">Big Gav&lt;/a> to get me motivated to work on this analysis.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;hr width=\"70%\"/>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\"I pledge not to go to war for oil\"&lt;/span> -- Jimmy Smits, fictional presidential candidate on the TV show, &lt;span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">West Wing&lt;/span>.&lt;br />&lt;br />Interesting live presentation of the show.&lt;br />&lt;br />Funny how it takes a fictional debate to bring a good discussion of energy issues to the American prime-time audience."},

There's nothing wrong with a little sex, or a whole lot.&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://is1.okcupid.com/graphics/square.gif\" border=\"1\" />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span shmolor=\"red\">AVOID&lt;/span>: &lt;i>The Slow Dancer&lt;/i>&lt;br />&lt;span shmolor=\"blue\">CONSIDER&lt;/span>: &lt;i>The 5-Night Stand&lt;/i>, &lt;i>The Hornivore&lt;/i>, &lt;i>The Playboy&lt;/i> &lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/tbody>&lt;/table>&lt;br />&lt;br />Link: &lt;a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/\">&lt;b>The 32-Type Dating Test&lt;/b>&lt;/a> by &lt;a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/\">&lt;b>&lt;b>OkCupid&lt;/b> - Free Online Dating&lt;/b>&lt;/a>.&lt;br />My profile name: &lt;a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/\" tuid=\"\">&lt;b>msmuggins&lt;/b>&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/tbody>&lt;/table>"},

The Western Roman Empire was in ruins and the Eastern Empire was based in Constantinople and trying desperately to keep the power of its early grandeur while transitioning to Christianity as a de facto state religion. The costs to the average person were unbearable as he was being required to meet the constantly rising taxes levied from the state along with the tithes coerced by the Church. What Islam offered was the &amp;#8220;carrot or the sword&amp;#8221;.&lt;br />&lt;br />If you became a convert, your taxes were immediately eliminated, as was your tithe. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t, you faced death. The choice was not hard for most to make, unless you were a very devoted martyr in the making. At the beginning, even the theology was not too hard for most to swallow, considering that both Judaism and Christianity were given their due by the Prophet. There is but one God-Allah, and Muhammad is His Prophet, as was Jesus, and the pre-Christian Jewish prophets of the Torah (old testament). Both were called &amp;#8220;children of the book&amp;#8221;, the book being the Koran, which replaced both the Old and New testaments for Christians and Jews.&lt;br />&lt;br />With this practical approach to spreading the &amp;#8220;word&amp;#8221; Islam grew like wild fire, reaching out from the Saudi Arabian Peninsula in all directions. This early growth is what the Muslims call the &amp;#8220;first&amp;#8221; great Jihad and it met with little resistance until Charles Martel of France, the father of Charlemagne, stopped them in the battle of Tours in France, after they had firmly established the religion on the Iberian peninsula. This first onslaught against the West continued in various forms and at various times until Islam was finally driven out of Spain in 1492 at the battle of Granada. &lt;br />&lt;br />The &amp;#8220;second great jihad&amp;#8221; came with the Ottoman Turks. This empire succeeded in bringing about the downfall of Constantinople as a Christian stronghold and an end to Roman hegemony in all of its forms. The Ottoman Empire was Islam&amp;rsquo;s most successful expansion of territory even though the religion itself had fractured into warring sects and bitter rivalries with each claiming the ultimate truths in &amp;#8220;the ways of the Prophet&amp;#8221;. By 1683 the Ottomans had suffered a series of defeats on both land and sea and the final and failed attempt to capture Vienna set the stage for the collapse of any further territorial ambitions and Islam shrunk into various sheikhdoms, emir dominated principalities, and roving tribes of nomads. However, by this time a growing anti-western sentiment, blaming its internal failures on anyone but themselves, was taking hold and setting the stage for a new revival know has Wahhabism which came into full bloom under the House of Saud on the Arabian peninsula shortly before the onset of WWI. It is this Wahhabi version of Islam which has infected the religion itself, now finding adherents in almost all branches and sects, especially the Shiites. What this sect calls for is the complete and total rejection of anything and everything which is not based in the original teachings of The Prophet and it finds its most glaring practice in the policies of the Afgani Taliban or the Shiite practices of the late Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran. Its Ali Pasha (Field Marshall) is now known as Osama bin Laden, the leader of the &amp;#8220;third Jihad&amp;#8221;.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Jimmy Carter sets the stage&lt;br />&lt;/b>&lt;br />The strategy for this &amp;#8220;holy war&amp;#8221; did not begin with the planning of the destruction of the World Trade Center. It began with the plans for toppling the Shah of Iran back in the early 1970&amp;rsquo;s and culminated with his exile in 1979. With his plans and programs to &amp;#8220;westernize&amp;#8221; his country, along with his close ties to the U.S. and subdued acceptance of the State of Israel, the Shah was the soft target.&lt;br />&lt;br />Thanks, in large part to the hypocritical and disastrous policies of the Jimmy Carter State Department the revolution was set into motion, the Shah was deposed, his arm forces scattered or murdered and stage one was complete. The Third Jihad now had a base of operations and the oil wealth to support its grand design or what they call the &amp;#8220;Great Caliphate&amp;#8221;.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>The Great Caliphate&lt;br />&lt;/b>&lt;br />What this design calls for is the replacement of all secular leadership in any country with Muslim majorities. This would include, Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan, Indonesia, all the Emirates, Sudan, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and finally what they call the &amp;#8220;occupied territory&amp;#8221; Israel.&lt;br />&lt;br />As a part of this strategy, forces of the jihad will infiltrate governments and the military as a prelude to taking control, once the secular leadership is ousted or assassinated. Such was the case in Lebanon leading to the Syrian occupation and what was attempted in Egypt with the murder of Anwar Sadat, along with the multiple attempts on the lives of Hussein in Jordan, Mubarak of Egypt and Musharraf in Pakistan. Pakistan is a particular prize because of its nuclear weapons.&lt;br />&lt;br />The long-range strategy of the Third Jihad counts on three strategic goals. 1. The U.S. withdrawing from the region just as it did in Southeast Asia, following Vietnam. 2. Taking control of the oil wealth in the Muslim countries, which would be upwards to 75% of known reserves, and 3. Using nuclear weapons or other WMDs to annihilate Israel. A further outcome of successfully achieving these objectives would be to place the United Nations as the sole arbiter in East/West negotiations.&lt;br />&lt;br />Evidence of the Bush Administration awareness of this plan is found in the facts that immediately following the 9/11 attack, their first move was to shore up Pakistan and Egypt, believing that these two would be the next targets for al Qaeda while Americans focused on the disaster in New York. The administration also knew that the most important objective was to send a loud and clear message that the U.S. was in the region to stay, not only to shore up our allies but to send a message to the Jihadists. The attack on Afghanistan was necessary to break-up a secure al Qaeda base of operations and put their leadership on the run or in prison. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Why Iraq?&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/b>The war on Iraq also met a very strategic necessity in that no one knew how much collaboration existed between Saddam Hussein and the master planners of the Third Jihad or his willingness to hand off WMDs to terrorist groups including the PLO in Israel. What was known, were serious indications of on-going collaboration, as Saddam funneled money to families of suicide bombers attacking the Israelis and others in Kuwait.&lt;br />&lt;br />What the U.S. needed to establish was a significant base of operations smack dab in the middle of the Islamic world, in a location which effectively cut it in half. Iraq was the ideal target for this and a host of other strategic reasons.&lt;br />&lt;br />Leadership of various anti-American groups both here and abroad understood the vital nature of the Bush initiative and thus launched their demonstrations, world-wide, to &amp;#8220;Stop The War&amp;#8221;. Failing this, they also laid plans to build a political campaign inside the country, with the War in Iraq as a plebiscite, using a little know politician as the thrust point; Howard Dean. This helps to explain how quickly the Radical Left moved into the Dean campaign with both people and money, creating what the clueless media called the &amp;#8220;Dean Phenomenon&amp;#8221;. &lt;br />&lt;br />By building on the left-wing base in the Democrat party and the &amp;#8220;Hate Bush&amp;#8221; liberals, the campaign has already resulted in a consensus among the aspirants, minus Joe Lieberman, to withdraw the U.S. from Iraq and turn the operation over to the U.N. And, if past is prologue, i.e. Vietnam, once the U.S. leaves it will not go back under any circumstances, possibly even the destruction of Israel.&lt;br />&lt;br />Should George W. Bush be defeated in November and a new administration come to power we could expect to see the dominoes start to fall in the secular Islamic countries and The Clash of Civilizations would then become a life changing event in all of our lives.&lt;br />&lt;br />What surprised the Jihadists following the 9/11 attack was how American sentiment mobilized around the president and a profound sense of patriotism spread across the country They were not expecting this reaction, based on what had happened in the past, nor were they expecting the determined resolve of the President himself. I believe that this is one of the reasons we have not had any further attacks within our borders. They are content to wait, just as one of their tactical mentors, V.I. Lenin admonished&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;two steps forward, one step back&amp;#8221;.&lt;br />&lt;br />A couple of additional events serve as valuable footnotes to the current circumstances we face: the destruction of the human assets factor of the CIA during the Carter presidency, presided over by the late Senator Frank Church and Carter&amp;rsquo;s CIA Director, Admiral Stansfield Turner. This fact has plagued our intelligence agencies right up to this very day with consequences which are now obvious. Jimmy Carter is the one man who must bear the bulk of the responsibility for setting the stage of the Third Jihad. Americans should find little comfort in how the Democrat contenders constantly seek the &amp;#8220;advice and counsel&amp;#8221; of this despicable little hypocrite who now prances around with his Nobel Prize, while attacking President Bush with almost as much venom as his fellow Nobel Laureate, Yassir Arafat.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>We should not expect to see any meaningful cooperation from Western Europe, especially the French.&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Since failing to protect their own interests in Algeria by turning the country over to the first of the Arab terrorists, Amid Ben Bella, the country itself is now occupied by Islamic immigrants totally twenty percent of the population. &lt;br />We are in the battle of our lives which will go on for many years possibly even generations. If we fail to understand what we are facing or falter in the challenge of &amp;#8220;knowing our enemy&amp;#8221; the results will be catastrophic. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>PART II (May 1, 2004) &lt;br />&lt;/b>&lt;br />Since writing the above, we have witnessed some frightening evidence in support of our hypothesis both internally and in other parts of the world.&lt;br />&lt;br />The al Qaeda bombing in Madrid has emboldened our enemy into believing it can use terror as an instrument for democratic regime change. Based on what happened there, they may be right.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Kerry and bin Laden on the same page&lt;/b> &lt;br />&lt;br />John Kerry and other leaders of his party constantly refer to the United States as &amp;#8220;acting unilaterally.&amp;#8221; They give no credit whatsoever to countries like Great Britain, Poland, Italy, Australia or even tiny Honduras for putting their limited armed forces in harm&amp;rsquo;s way to support the U.S. led coalition in Iraq. It is little wonder that some are considering doing what Spain has done&amp;#8212;pulling out. The leaders in these countries have spent considerable political capital in this effort, and have little to show for it as it relates to fostering good will with the American public. Couple that fact with Osama bin Ladin&amp;rsquo;s latest offer of withholding attacks on those who &amp;#8220;quit&amp;#8221; the coalition and you have all the elements for a Democrat party fostered &amp;#8220;self-fulfilling prophecy&amp;#8221; where the U.S. will be totally alone in the pacification of Iraq. John Kerry and the Bush critics persist in the &amp;#8220;lie&amp;#8221; of the U.S. going it &amp;#8220;alone&amp;#8221; in Iraq but Osama bin Laden knows differently and will use the Kerry rhetoric to help isolate the U.S. The terrorists now see themselves as political &amp;#8220;king-makers&amp;#8221;. They may be right.&lt;br />&lt;br />Another aspect of the &amp;#8220;anti-Bush&amp;#8221; political axis is how both his political enemies and the main stream media take ghoulish delight in &amp;#8220;the body count,&amp;#8221; just as they did in the later days of Vietnam. Oh sure, they pay incidental homage to the memory of the young Americans who gave their lives in the greatest threat this country has ever faced, but they do so with all the sincerity of Madonna making a vow of chastity. As the body bags grow in number, they believe, so grows their political prospects. They may be right.&lt;br />&lt;br />If the Bush administration is further weakened in the months leading up to the November elections, we will witness a heightened al Qaeda offensive in all parts of the world, including our own country, and especially in Iraq and nations surrounding it ,i.e., Pakistan, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Events within the past few days in Jordan not only make this argument but also point to the possibility of &amp;#8220;what happened to the WMDs.&amp;#8221;&lt;br />Iran and Syria are daily growing more overt and bold in their support of insurgents within Iraq, believing that Bush has been so hurt by internal politics that he is powerless to act against them in any meaningful way. They may be right.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>The Leftwing initiative, Political Correctness and Our Will to Win&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Within our own country we are witnessing and almost insane application of &amp;#8220;political correctness.&amp;#8221; As the barbarism of radical Islam grows more apparent in the streets of the Middle East from Gaza to Basra, we see a cultural suicide taking place within our own schools and communities.&lt;br />&lt;br />Our children are being taught from the Koran, our professors are preaching intifadah in their class rooms, and Muslim &amp;#8220;call to prayer&amp;#8221; loud speakers are blaring out from city halls. The more precarious our very existence becomes, the more our liberal brethren embrace their enemies. It is a Stockholm Syndrome which can only lead to the recruitment of young Muslims who will be willing to duplicate in the West what their co-religionists are doing in the streets of Israel and the market places of Baghdad. The liberal P.C. crowd say nothing about the silence of the Muslim religious leadership as it relates to the carnage of innocents but couldn&amp;rsquo;t speak out fast enough against the inspiration supplied to tens of millions of Christians by Mel Gibson&amp;rsquo;s The Passion of the Christ. They were put off by the movie&amp;rsquo;s &amp;#8220;violence&amp;#8221; and its alleged &amp;#8220;fostering of anti-Semitism&amp;#8221;. Movies must represent their &amp;#8220;reality&amp;#8221; as the real thing moves them not at all. Among liberal Jews in America, hatred of George W. Bush is only surpassed by their contempt for Ariel Sharon&amp;#8230;Let them explain it, I am at a total loss to do so. Maybe they just miss seeing Bill Clinton smooching Yassir Arafat in the White House Rose Garden. &lt;br />&lt;br />The &amp;#8220;Reverend&amp;#8221; Jesse Jackson is now calling the U.S. &amp;#8220;guilty of crimes against humanity&amp;#8221; as he sets out to mobilize the non-Islamic Left. None of the Democrat leadership says a word in opposition to Jackson&amp;rsquo;s treason or Hillary&amp;rsquo;s attacks on the President and U.S. policy in an Arabic newspaper, while in London. You can bet that al Jezeera didn&amp;rsquo;t miss a beat in their reporting of both events.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>The campaign takes its toll&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />The campaign is seriously hurting Mr. Bush&amp;rsquo;s leadership role in the War on Terror. While ducking every new book critical of his initiative or trying to counter the partisan nitpicking of the 9/11 Commission, he has persisted in the misbegotten insistence of &amp;#8220;installing democracy&amp;#8221; in Iraq. Our purpose for being in that beleaguered country should be restricted to one purpose and one purpose only, to stop the expansion of The Third Jihad and provide a base for doing same in the neighboring areas. This can be done by sealing the borders, attacking anything that moves in violation of same and by making it clear to Syria and Iran that any participation on their part will be considered an &amp;#8220;act of war&amp;#8221;. Let the country be governed by the local tribes, Shiite in the south, Sunni in the central and Kurds in the north with a U.S. pro consul overseeing the military. Oil revenues could be spilt by population allocation. How about installing a Republic&amp;#8230;it worked pretty well here with diverse populations.&lt;br />&lt;br />The very idea that we should spend our sons and daughters blood or our tax dollars on trying to building a &amp;#8220;democracy&amp;#8221; in the region which has neither a history nor a desire for such, is sheer nonsense. The very essence of Islamic teaching speaks directly against this principle. Continuing on the current path can only result in fostering greater hatred for the &amp;#8220;Great Satan&amp;#8221;. Force is the only thing which is respected in that part of the world and this force need not be tied to &amp;#8220;reform&amp;#8221;. I suggest Mr. Rumsfled acquaint himself with a copy of Julius Caesar&amp;rsquo;s Gallic Wars and Sun Tsu&amp;rsquo;s Art of War. All the tactics and strategies necessary to subdue the Iraqi insurgents can be found in those two military gems.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Please not the UN&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Bringing the U.N. to the party will only compound the problem without adding any accountability. The U.N. has been accused of many things over the years, but being a &amp;#8220;democratic&amp;#8221; institution has never been one of them. Just the latest scandal of the &amp;#8220;Oil for Food&amp;#8221; program should provide any thinking person with all the evidence they need to keep the U.N. at bay. But this doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to bother the likes of the John Kerry&amp;rsquo;s of the world who prattle on as if the scam doesn&amp;rsquo;t even exist.&lt;br />&lt;br />Just one example will make my case; the UN mandate in Israel, which has been in place since 1948. One more salient point needs to be made on this subject. There is no such thing as &amp;#8220;The International Community.&amp;#8221; There are only individual countries, each with its own agenda which is always self serving. The myth of a higher level of &amp;#8220;moral authority&amp;#8221; coming out of the UN as been one of the greater lies of the past half century, but it is a lie which persists in spite of a bloody record of hypocrisy, graft, genocide and &amp;#8220;perpetual war for perpetual peace.&amp;#8221; I have a suggestion for the 9/11 Commission:.Why don&amp;rsquo;t they look into what the UN was doing before the attack on the World Trade Center? If they do, they will find that exactly one week before, the UN was holding a Conference on Racism in Durbin, South Africa where the delegates voted overwhelmingly to condemn Israel, as &amp;#8220;racist and terrorist.&amp;#8221; The U.S., Canadian and Israeli delegates walked out in disgust. Nary a word was uttered about Saddam Hussein, al Qaeda, or the Taliban, to say nothing of what was happening in Rwanda while they crunched caviar on toast and washed it down with vintage Champaign. Genocide does not qualify as &amp;#8220;racism&amp;#8221; according to the UN &amp;#8220;morality.&amp;#8221; Neither we nor the world needs the UN to muck up what is already a very delicate situation. If given proper leadership every Middle Eastern country named above will throw in with the Coalition, for if they don&amp;rsquo;t they will be the next targets of the Third Great Jihad and the Great Caliphate. Pakistan is already showing the leadership which others will follow. What do you think moved Kadahaffi to cozy up to the U.S. and Great Britain? He fears the Jihadist more than he hates us.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Evil Does Exist&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Our current crises, in meeting the threat of the Third Jihad, is one more example of how most Americans simply refuse to believe there is evil in this world and are willing to grant moral equivalence on any human action. Unless the crime is personalized such as in the case of Lacy Peterson, we lose interest quickly and become bored or at least not involved.&lt;br />&lt;br />To try and understand what we are facing, look into the eyes of your son or grandson and try to fathom a mind which would take pride in strapping a bomb to his body and sending him out to kill himself and countless innocent people. Or in the case of your daughter or grand daughter, try to imagine a religion which commands you to mutilate her vagina to destroy her sex drive or demands you to stone her to death if she has sexual relations with a man other than of your choosing.&lt;br />&lt;br />If you can comprehend these facts both intellectually and emotionally, then you will start to understand what we are facing in the months and years ahead, both at home and abroad. &lt;br />&lt;br />The radicals of Islam will stop at nothing to destroy us and all we stand for. They see this war as their &amp;#8220;entry to paradise&amp;#8221; and a release from the miserable existence they have built for themselves within the confines of an evil and perverse religion. The Jihadist are NOT like us, nor most of their fellow Muslims. But, like terrorists everywhere they have silenced any criticisms from fellow Muslims through threat and intimidation and have, with the help of the &amp;lsquo;useful idiots&amp;#8221; in the West, &amp;#8220;created the appearance of popular support&amp;#8221;.&lt;br />&lt;br />If we are incapable of understanding these realities and acting accordingly, within the life time of everyone who reads these words, we will see our cherished way of like cease to exist and chaos become our lot. The Clash of Civilizations is now reaching out and touching all of us. May God grant us the wisdom and the courage to meet the challenge.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div align=\"center\">&lt;b>&lt;a href=\"http://www.patriotsunite.com\" title=\"Patriots Unite\" target=\"_blank\">Patriots Unite&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&lt;/div>"},

Ramon's attic overlooked a vast carpet of trees which he could espy through&lt;br />a telescope (ordered through Amazon) and it was all quiet. But over by a clump&lt;br />of bushes near a hill, Hector thought he could see two red pinpoints of light&lt;br />gleaming in the dark space between the vegetation.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;Dad&amp;quot;, he said, &amp;quot;let's go out and wander in the woods!&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;No&amp;quot;, Ramon said, &amp;quot;that would be a &lt;b>bad&lt;/b> idea.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;Come on, Dad, I think it would be &lt;i>exciting&lt;/i>.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;You mean it would be dumb.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;Exciting is when something unusual happens to you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;I'll bet you see something unusual in the woods!&amp;quot; said Ramon.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;Only two lousy pinpoints of red light&amp;quot;, said Hector.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;Those are eyes. Monster eyes&amp;quot;, said Ramon.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>&amp;quot;Uh ... oh!&amp;quot;, mumbled Hector in a disappointed way.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>Hector went back to his room and thought: 'how can I help Dad?' Then he had&lt;br />an idea. When Ramon was asleep, he would creep out of his room and start the&lt;br />elevator which ran from the bottom of his tree house to the top so that anyone&lt;br />on the forest floor could come up and visit! That would &lt;i>really help&lt;/i> dad.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>Meanwhile, down in the jungle, a horrible monster steadily advanced on&lt;br />Ramon's tree house. It was a great, slimy beast, with two red glowing eyes, a&lt;br />set of razor-sharp fangs and claws plus an insatiable appetite for eating little&lt;br />boys. (It also had cruel talons). But when it got to the base of the mighty&lt;br />tree, on which Ramon's tree house was perched too far above him to reach, he&lt;br />could go no further.&lt;/p>&lt;br />&lt;p>Just then the light above the elevator on the ground floor was illuminated.&lt;br />The door whisked open and the monster found he could enter the elevator leading&lt;br />to the top floor -- and a meal of little boy.&lt;/p>"},

I actually managed to sleep a bit longer this morning. The day before sleep started at 12am, which only gave me 4:30 hours to sleep. Last night I went to sleep at 11pm, which is 5:30 hours of sleep, but still not enough. I need to start going to sleep around 8-9pm. I get off work at 3:00pm, and at that time I usually meet up with a friend of mine who gets off at 3pm for lunch, so we hang out and talk for a bit. Today I am just going to go to home and probably sleep for a bit.&lt;br />&lt;br />I have to concider moving out here pretty soon, because Dell is moving from the downtown core, and it may prove to be difficult to make it to work. Hopefully by the time Dell moves, I will have a raise of my salary and I will be able to manage a bit better with rent and that kind of thing. Its probably going to end up costing me about 1200 in living expenses (rent, food, internets, heat, water) that sort of thing. Although I am pretty sure I can find some rent for very decent price. I don't believe I will be living paycheck to paycheck though, especially if I work everyday and I don't take any time off..&lt;br />&lt;br />I'm starting to wake up now. I guess I just had to be a big groggy this morning, it can't be dodged I am going to feel this way no matter what. Unfortunately I seem to have the bad end of the spectrym. I guess I just need to work out a bit and get my endurance back. Perhaps purchasing a bike isn't such a bad idea for the summer. It wouldn't be so bad. But if it was raining heavily, or snowing like it was yesterday, then I'd probably have to plan ahead and take the bus, and whether I can rely on myself to check on that is another question. I honestly though I was going to give up after the 1st day, but I'm starting to obsorb the material in class, and I am learning it at a good pace. There is a lot to cover in this course, and I can't wait to start this job soon. Only 2 more weeks of training after this and we hit the floor.&lt;br />&lt;br />When the building moves... timing expected to be in July, I'll start to move. That or I'll ask my parents if I can pay rent without any more questions, and they can let me have the basement. I'm willing to pay $500 for room and board which is pretty sweet deal. That would definately look good. That $500 could go a long way for my parents, and help out a lot when it comes to having things like Food and having bills paid for, and ease the tension in the house a whole lot. My income would definately be a great asset. However I don't want to live at home forever, but for now that actually seems quite feasible. I know I don't cost much to maintain, concidering I actually take a good job of taking care of myself... feeding and clothing myself. All I need is a place to sleep that is hopefully warm, and I don't even want to know what it feels like sleep on a bench.&lt;br />&lt;br />But for now this is the way things are. My life seems to be really taking off, and hopefully things will only improve from here on in."},

And I haven't even seen the first ad yet.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Actually, I have seen &lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/emayoh/62678035/\">this photo of a billboard&lt;/a> and I just watched the commercial which is available &lt;a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=1448925\">here&lt;/a> from &lt;a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/\">abcnews.com&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />For those of you who don't want to bother to watch it, I'll give you the rundown:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;blockquote>The scene is a wedding reception, winding down, slow song at the end of the night.  You see one young man who is obviously wasted, stumbling around, stumbling up to the stage and banging on the band's drums.  &lt;br />&lt;br />The voiceover says, \"It's easy to tell when you've had way too many.  But what about when you've had one too many?\"  &lt;br />&lt;br />Now you see an apparently sober looking man, drinking a last gulp from his drink before he and his wife head out the door.&lt;br />&lt;br />Finally, the voiceover says, \"Buzzed Driving is Drunk Driving.\"&lt;/blockquote>&lt;br />First, let me start with the personal and get it out of the way.  I don't condone drunk driving, I don't drive drunk.  Throughout college, my friends and I always had a designated driver or just walked home.  Now, I'm lucky to live in an area where I pretty much never drive anywhere, so it's not much of an issue.  But if I go somewhere and I know I'm going to have to drive, say a wedding, I would probably have only one drink, two at the most, depending on how many hours I'm going to be there.  It's fair to say that I err on the side of caution when it comes to drinking and driving.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Now the legal.  The point of this ad campaign, I believe, is to draw the following line of thought:&lt;br />&lt;br />Buzzed Driving = Drunk Driving = Illegal...&lt;br />Therefore, Buzzed Driving = Illegal&lt;br />&lt;br />Which just simply isn't true.  It's a clear misstatement of the law.  In fact, as a defense attorney, when we voir dire in drunk driving cases, one of the things that we want to be sure that every juror understands is that it is not illegal to drink and drive, it is only illegal to drive while legally intoxicated.  &lt;br />&lt;br />So, what is the legal definition of intoxicated?  Simple.  And very objective.  A blood alcohol level above .08 is legally intoxicated.  &lt;br />&lt;br />How drunk is .08?  Well, that's the part that's kind of subjective.  Different people are going to feel and function differently at .08.  &lt;a href=\"http://www.ou.edu/oupd/bac.htm\">This BAC calculator&lt;/a> is kind of fun to play with and gives you an idea of what your BAC.  Even MADD  tells us that:&lt;br />&lt;blockquote>To reach a .08 BAC level, a 170-pound man would have to drink approximately four drinks in one hour on an empty stomach or a 137-pound woman would have to drink approximately three drinks in one hour on an empty stomach.&lt;/blockquote>&lt;br />That's quite a bit.  But, I think the question remains, how do you feel at .08?  Do you feel, \"Whoa, I'm wasted!\" or do you feel, \"Hey, I've got a little buzz on, but I'm good to drive?\"&lt;br />&lt;br />In speaking to experts on the subject (and I mean actual PhDs, not just &lt;a href=\"http://nakeddrinkingcoffee.blogspot.com/2005/12/im-magic.html\">people who drink a lot&lt;/a>), it really just depends on the person.  Experts tell us that people who drink very frequently may be able to function quite well, even at very high BACs.  Likewise, ask around and you'll find that many people have been to parties where the drinks were either very watered down or not alcoholic at all, and yet one person who didn't know this stumbled around saying, \"I'm getting sooo drunk!\"  Are they just faking?  No, experts say that a large part of how drunk we feel or act is in our heads.&lt;br />&lt;br />Other factors, besides a person's drinking history, is how much they've had to eat, their size, the types of drinks, the time period during which they had the drinks and the time period since the last drink.  &lt;br />&lt;br />(For example, imagine someone doing four shots of tequila and then immediately getting into a car to drive just a few blocks.  Science tells us that they can't yet be intoxicated - the alcohol hasn't had time to enter their bloodstream.  But imagine a cat jumps out in the street, they swerve to avoid it, and hit a parked car.  When the police come, they're going to smell the alcohol.  And by the time you get down to the station and take the test, he's going to blow a BAC much higher that what he had at the time of the accident.)&lt;br />&lt;br />So, why is this ad campaign driving me nuts?  What's so untrue about it?  It's a real under-exaggeration of the legal standard for intoxication.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Look again at the \"buzzed\" guy.  There aren't even any other empty glasses on the table!  And he didn't even finish that one drink!  True, he kind of bumped into the door.  Maybe he's just klutzy.  Or being gentlemanly and making sure there's enough room for his wife to get through the door.  I don't think there's anything to lead us to believe he's had much to drink except that one gulp we saw - and there's certainly nothing to lead us to believe he has had \"one drink too many.\"  Unless we're going along with MADD and saying that even one drink is one drink too many.&lt;br />&lt;br />Finally, what does all of this have to do with driving?  Are buzzed drivers causing accidents?  In general, the answer is no.  &lt;br />&lt;br />In the cases I've seen where a DWI arrest is made for someone driving with a BAC between .08 and around .12, nearly 100% of those arrests are made as the result of a checkpoint stop.  In other words, the drivers with BACs at or near .08 simply aren't drivers that are causing accidents.  Instead, in most of the DWI accident cases I've seen, and there's a lot of empirical evidence to support this, the BACs are higher - usually over .12.  These are clients that, even when I interview them hours later, still smell like alcohol, still have slurred speech, and often can't remember what happened.  &lt;br />&lt;br />But I understand that a cutoff needs to be set.  And I even agree that it should be set on the lower side, again, erring on the side of caution and keeping in mind that alcohol effects each person differently.  &lt;br />&lt;br />My real problem is with the use of the word \"buzzed,\" a very subjective word, that to some people may mean that first warm feeling you get from just a sip of alcohol, and to others it may mean something a lot closer to \"drunk.\"  &lt;br />&lt;br />(Kind of like some people think \"hooking up\" is something along the lines of making out or fooling around or whatever, and other people think \"hooking up\" means actual sex.  It's all just slang.  It's not like you can look it up in the dictionary and see what \"buzzed\" or \"hooking up\" means.)&lt;br />&lt;br />And it seems that maybe this commercial wants you to believe that \"buzzed\" could mean one drink or less.  There certainly is no further explanation as to how much the \"buzzed\" man in the commercial has had to drink.  And yet, it's being equated to drunk and illegal driving.  &lt;br />&lt;br />It's misleading and it's a misstatement of the law.  Many people rely on the media to tell them the state of the laws.  When a new law goes into effect, or a law is changed, people expect to hear about it on television.  I'm concerned that people will mistake this advertisement for a report on the current state of the law.  And, I don't want any juror who has seen this commercial or who believes it, for fear that they may substitute this advertisement's misstatement of the law for the actual law, despite the correct instructions from the judge."},

Hah, anyways. Mrs Ang gave us lots of math homework and I'm now too tired to do them. Or in other words, \"Just too lazy!\" Not only that, I went to re-wrote Numb for social studies! Hahahaha, made it so dumb. I'm just stuborn sometimes. Can go re-write songs but can't do maths homework. I should have just went to take Lit sia.

Perimenopause is defined as the period beginning with the signs of approaching menopause and ending about 12 months after \u201cthe menopause\u201d.&lt;br />&lt;br />Worldwide, menopause has as a variety of meanings. Each and every woman\u2019s experience is based on her physical and emotional well being as well as her social and cultural environments. While some view menopause as a decline in status, others see it as a rite of passage. In other words, there are huge physical, emotional and social influences involved in your experience of menopause and aging.&lt;br />&lt;br />That said, what you really want to know is \u2013 \u201cWhat will I experience\u201d?&lt;br />&lt;br />This is tricky, as the answer is different for every woman. Some women barely notice a warm flush, while others have an intense reaction. So as you read some of the more common occurrences, please keep in mind \u2013 you will do your own thing.&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>Power Surges, night sweats (they can be all day!) and chills&lt;/li>&lt;li>Insomnia, and/or poor quality of sleep&lt;/li>&lt;li>Urinary frequency, discomfort and sometimes leakiness&lt;/li>&lt;li>Vaginal dryness, irritation and possibly discomfort with sexual activity&lt;/li>&lt;li>Moodiness. Perhaps some irritation, nervousness, anxiety and depression.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Diminished libido (sexual desire)&lt;/li>&lt;li>Memory issues! Some women call this \u201cthe pause\u201d (among other things).&lt;/li>&lt;li>Joint pain and stiffness&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;p>In case you think all the reactions are negative, take a look at some of the more positive and more important changes that happen to women. &lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Freedom&lt;/li>&lt;li>Joy&lt;/li>&lt;li>Greater sense of Creativity&lt;/li>&lt;li>A sense of peace that has not been previously been present.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Wisdom that only comes to those with time and conscious living.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;p>Just as there are many responses to the onset of menopause, there are many approaches you can take to meet these changes. As with anything, you must weigh any risk against the benefit (this is especially true when you consider hormone therapy), your belief system, and finally, you must find something that works for you.&lt;br />&lt;br />Most approaches are common sense and actions we need to take daily. Others are meant to challenge your thinking and open your mind. Possible ways to approach menopause include: &lt;/p>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Healthy food and fluid intake&lt;/li>&lt;li>Nutriceuticals such as vitamins and herbal supplements&lt;/li>&lt;li>Exercise at least 30 minutes daily&lt;/li>&lt;li>Traditional Chinese Medicine such has acupuncture, Chinese herbs, Qi Gong and Tai Chi&lt;/li>&lt;li>Adjust your attitude! Laugh and have fun. Hang out with your girlfriends and delight in NOT being 25 again!&lt;/li>&lt;li>Meditation, visualization and biofeedback&lt;/li>&lt;li>Natural, Bio-identical and pharmaceutical grade hormone therapy&lt;/li>&lt;br />&lt;/ul>This is a time of your life where you can count on change, and the growth that comes from it. As the power surges through our bodies, we grow into the women we are meant to be. We fulfill our goals and move on to make new ones. While our focus is inward, our outward gaze sharpens and our dreams are manifested for all to celebrate. It really is a magnificent time.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the coming months, OlderWiserWomen will explore these areas in greater detail, so stay tuned.&lt;br />&lt;br />\u00a92005 Barbara C.

Scholars are also ranked, however. The OMS males then OMS females then SGS males then SGS females then Local scholar males then Local scholar females then everybody else. In the MFA at least. There's a large bit of me that yells at my brain that it's no fair, stop pigeonholing, just because i fell down the wrong side of the pinball machine earlier doesn't mean that i ain't just as good as the other pinballs! But the small bit of me that's control freaky and pro-establishment says 'but that's the most efficient way...'. I'm just wondering if the pinball is really different from the other pinballs that went to pinball heaven but is blind to its own imperfections. I don't want to be blind. And I don't want to be pigeonholed. They might well both be facts of life, the latter especially on our Little Sunny Island set in the Sea, Inc.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Once my hair dries I will go to sleep.

Scourge in point: the computer cheater. All too often, people will fire up their chess software in the background, or on a second machine, or even directly to the server interface and attempt to steal victories, rating points and occasionally even money from their victims. Often they're caught - sometimes sooner, sometimes later - but they're always a nuisance.&lt;br />&lt;br />They don't always succeed, however - sometimes the good guys absorb the computer's blows and survive or even win. What follows is one of my more satisfying online victories, over a player I realized early on was a computer cheat.&lt;br />&lt;br />Bad Guy-DM, 15-minute game, ICC 2000&lt;br />&lt;br />1.Nf3 Nf6 2.d4 d5 3.Bf4 g6 4.e3 Bg7 5.Be2 Nbd7 6.O-O O-O 7.Nbd2 b6 8.c3 Bb7 9.Qa4 c5 10.Rfe1 a6 11.Qd1&lt;br />&lt;br />At this point, I suddenly feel suspicious. My opponent is a good player, his rating is fairly high, so what's with 9.Qa4 one move and 11.Qd1 two moves later? The retreat might be sensible, but it's not the sort of move a human would just play, and quickly, if only because of the embarrassment factor.&lt;br />&lt;br />11...Ne4 12.Rb1 Rc8 13.Qc2&lt;br />&lt;br />Okay, now I'm getting &lt;span style=\"font-style: italic;\">really&lt;/span> suspicious! Why not 9.Qc2 or 11.Qc2? And who makes such a move in response to my putting a rook on the c-file? That's the sort of thing strong players typically (though defeasibly) avoid!&lt;br />&lt;br />13...Re8 14.Rbc1 Nxd2 15.Qxd2 Nf6 16.Qd1&lt;br />&lt;br />Sigh. I always make a point of not bothering playing computers, but it's clear that's what I'm up against. As it's against the rules to use a chess engine (unless one's account is explicitly marked as a computer account), I started to request that the game be aborted. My opponent refused, and we continued:&lt;br />&lt;br />16...Ne4 17.Bd3 b5 18.a4 Qb6 19.axb5 axb5 20.Ne5 Red8&lt;br />&lt;br />Annoyed though I was, I felt pretty good about my position, but I was in for a surprise, as my opponent produced an extremely strong idea:&lt;br />&lt;br />21.Ra1! b4 22.Qb1!&lt;br />&lt;br />This is a fantastic prophylactic idea, as playing 22...bxc3 23.bxc3 favors White. I attempt a tactical solution to my problems, but my opponent is more than up to the challenge:&lt;br />&lt;br />22...Nd2 23.Qc2 bxc3 24.bxc3 Nb3 25.Ra4! c4 26.Rb4! Qa7&lt;br />&lt;br />Very nice play by White, who was moving extremely quickly, too, and taking pretty much the same amount of time on every move (another tell-tale sign of the computer cheat). What follows now is even more impressive, both as a chess idea and as evidence of the cheating claim:&lt;br />&lt;br />27.Bf1 e6 28.Bxc4!&lt;br />&lt;br />A very strange sequence - why not 27.Bxc4 straight away? That sort of freedom from embarrassment about past moves is typical of computers, but not at all of humans.&lt;br />&lt;br />28...dxc4 29.Nxc4 Bd5 30.Nb6 Nxd4 31.exd4 Rc6 32.Qb2 Bf8 33.Nxd5 exd5 34.Rb7 Qa3 35.Qxa3 Bxa3 36.Rb3 Bf8 37.h3 Re6&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://chessmind.powerblogs.com/files/NN_DM_1.jpg\" />&lt;br />&lt;br />White's play so far has been quite strong, and although overall I've played pretty well for a 15-minute game, my inaccuracies here and there have left it with an extra pawn. It's not the greatest extra pawn in the world, but it's certainly up to me to prove that I can hold the position.&lt;br />&lt;br />From here on out, however, White's play is bad in a way that would have been impossible for a human player exhibiting White's strength so far. The problem for White is that his queenside pawns are on dark squares while Black's are on light squares, thereby making White's bishop essentially impotent. Thus what's clear is that if the rooks are removed, it's a trivially easy task for Black to hold. Accordingly, White should avoid the exchange of at least one pair of rooks, when Black will have to suffer and grovel. But behold!&lt;br />&lt;br />38.Rxe6?! fxe6 39.Rb6 Kf7 40.Rb7+ Kg8 41.Kf1 Rc8 42.Rc7?? Rxc7 43.Bxc7&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://chessmind.powerblogs.com/files/NN_DM_2.jpg\" />&lt;br />&lt;br />Wow, that was easy! The position is perfect for me now - all my pawns are ideally placed, and White pawn advances simply lead to exchanges. I was way behind on the clock (I had two minutes left to White's seven and a half), but as I only need to play Kf7, Be7-f8-e7-f8-e7-f8 and trade the pawns as they come, I figured I'd have good chances to save the draw in spite of the clock.&lt;br />&lt;br />43...Kf7 44.Be5 Be7 45.Ke2 Bf8 46.Kd2 Be7 47.c4 dxc4 48.Kc3 Bf8 49.Kxc4 Be7&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://chessmind.powerblogs.com/files/NN_DM_3.jpg\" />&lt;br />&lt;br />and now check out White's next three moves, which taken together are completely insane.&lt;br />&lt;br />50.g3?! Bf8 51.h4?? Be7 52.f4? h5!&lt;br />&lt;br />Now it's really, really, really a dead draw, as White can never create so much as a single target in my position. But White finds resources in the position...for Black.&lt;br />&lt;br />53.Kd3 Bf8 54.Ke4 Be7 55.d5 exd5+ 56.Kxd5 Bf8 57.Kc6? Ke6 58.Kb5 Kf5 59.Kc6?? Bb4&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;img src=\"http://chessmind.powerblogs.com/files/NN_DM_4.jpg\" />&lt;br />&lt;br />and now, of course, it's over, as my bishop hoovers the White pawns.&lt;br />&lt;br />60.Kd7 Be1 61.Ke8 Bxg3 62.Kf8 Bxh4 63.Kg7 Bg3 64.Kh6 Bxf4+ 65.Bxf4 Kxf4 66.Kxg6 h4 0-1&lt;br />&lt;br />After the game I reported my opponent to the server's computer-cheat police, and some time later my judgement was confirmed. It's disappointing when people do that, but to be honest, it did make the win much, much sweeter than it would otherwise have been! (Not because it was a computer that was defeated, which is certainly pleasant enough, but because a cheater got his just desserts.)"},

Because this is such an emotional subject, I can foresee both ends of the political spectrum making this a polarizing issue. Liberals will maintain that conservatives are trying to eliminate economic opportunities for minorities; conservatives will insist that preferences in contracting is not only unfair, but actually undermines some of the basic principles civil rights advocates fought and died for.&lt;br />&lt;br />As an economist who leans neither left or right politically, I hope the Commission will look at the issue from an economic standpoint. Specifically, I would hope their study would analyze and address the following questions:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>Overall, has government contracting preferences benefits for exceeded its costs? If so, how?&lt;/li>&lt;li>How has preferential programs like 8(a) benefited the minority community over the long run? &lt;/li>&lt;li>What percentage of minority firms receiving preferential contracts have also developed successful opportunities in the private sector? &lt;/li>&lt;li>How have these minority firms affected distressed households and communities? &lt;/li>&lt;/ol>In my opinion, if minority (and other) firms that has received preferential federal contracts have helped increased economic opportunity in distressed communities where they otherwise would not have occurred, then contracting preferences by race and/or gender benefits may outweigh its costs. However, if these contracting preferences do not help \"lift all boats\", then contracting preference by race is an economic cost to this country that does the most harm to those it was initially intended to help."},

I stare at it, trying not to be too overwhelmed by its stare, its radiance. The ponytail bobs up and down as she shuffles to turn the page, I stare, mesmerized. She curls her feet around one another, her legs aching for some comfort as the digital clock at the bottom of the computer screen crawls towards 5 am.

Her parents, certainly are deserving of sympathy; it is surely difficult for them to let her go when they have tended to her so lovingly for so long.Perhaps they are victims of wishful thinking in claiming to see evidence of responsiveness on her part where none exists, but for this, too, they cannot be faulted -- this is a natural human tendency. If someone I loved were seriously ill and I thought there was still a medical chance of successful treatment, I, too, would do everything in my power to pursue it, even over the objections of other family members, of medical professionals, and of courts.&lt;br />&lt;br />From an impersonal standpoint, there are four major ethical issues at stake: First, there is the question of Terri's cognitive state, second, there is the question of patient rights to self-determination, third, there is the question of who should be empowered to make major medical decisions in the absence of clear statements of patients wishes, and fourth, there is the question of financial costs.&lt;br />&lt;br />Regarding Terri's cognitive state, although the overall consensus of neurologists who examined Terri is that she is in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) and thus unaware of her surroundings, unresponsive to stimuli, and insensitive to pain and discomfort, there may be legitimate ground for dissent on this point. The brain often exhibits great neural plasticity, readapting to compensate for some very serious injuries. &lt;br />&lt;br />Regarding Terri's right to decide her own fate: According to Terri's husband, Terri epressed a wish not to be kept alive in circumstances where she was wholly dependent on others for her most basic needs. If, in fact, these were her wishes, it seems she, like other patients, should have the right to refuse treatment. The problem here is that (a) not everyone is persuaded that these were, in fact, her wishes (there is nothing in writing indicating such wishes), and (b) people will sometimes SAY that they would not wish to receive treatment in some condition only to change their minds when the envisioned scenario becomes a reality.&lt;br />&lt;br />Third, regarding proxy decisions: from a legal standpoint, those who support removing life-sustaining devices from Terri are on firm footing. Courts have repeatedly determined that a spouse should be the primary consultant regarding a patients wishes when the patient is unable to express his/her own wishes. Still, it is at least morally tragic when the wishes of the spouse conflict with other members of the patient's family, as is the case with Terri Schiavo.&lt;br />&lt;br />Fourth, regarding costs: It is easy to dismiss this as a morally irrelevant concern. Ideally everyone should receive unlimited medical treatment irrespective of costs. This is not, however, a reality. The reality is that in a world of limited resources, expenditures for one may deprive another of desired or needed resources. This is why it is important to determine whether Terri could stand to benefit in a meaningful way from continued treatment. This is a decision best made by medical professionals. But here, too, the refusal of courts to allow reinvestigation of Terri's condidtion render problematic the claim that she could not benefit from continued treatment. Of course, some assessments have been made, and at some point one must forego further assessments and reassessments and act on the information one has already gathered. Acting on Terri's case calls out for articulation of a general rule by which other, similar cases are to be decided. This is all the more important because of the reality that precludes continued treatment for all patients suffering similar injuries.&lt;br />&lt;br />Conclusion: The case here is not straightforward. It is definitely tricky; tricky enough that dogmatic conclusions either for or against ending her treatment are ill-advised. Going forward with any option ought, it seems to me, to be done with a reasonable measure of uncertainty regarding the moral status of one's decision. Significant moral decisions should rarely, if ever, be made from a standpoint of dogmatic arrogance."},

I remember when we were like 8 and we played these lame games like try to make the other person laugh and we'd end up in complete hysterics no matter what, and well we almost always end up in hysterics no matter what. That's one thing I love about friends, no matter what happens, where you are, whatever the condtions they can always seem to make you feel better. Just so you all know I appriciate friends so much. Too bad I'm not hanging out with any now... oh wait my parents want me to be a hermit. I'm pretty convinvced of this fact actually. My Dad and I got in big fight like 2 days ago. He accused me of not caring about my family at all and all this other shit that's completely untrue, i think he honestly tries to piss me off sometimes. The main point of the fight was I should go out once every month and stay home cleaning and taking care of my sibs to show my true dedication to my family. Anyway, that kinda sucked, my break hasn't been bad by any streach tho. Saved is the funniest movie... I'm kinda in love with the gay guy in it, heh heh. I\"M just so glad to not be at school, I\"m getting like senioritis and I\"m not even a senior. I seriously couldn't do any work the last week of school. Oh well. Hmm what else have I been doing? I think I write this just for myself, so i can figure out what's going on in my life i mean no one really reads it but that's ok... Well I won $105 dollars the other weekend in run for the roses. I got 3rd girl over all and sean and i won the couples race so we each got 50 for that. It was funny tho b/c when we went up to get our awards everytone thought we were together for real and was like awww. ha ha it made me laugh.ASo So I got to get some new shoes. and i'm already like stocking up on clothes for nexet year when i'm done wearing white polos. so i've done a lotta shopping. I wrote a letter to the editor yesterday about how CAFTA which the Bush administration is supporting is an idiotic idea, althought I didn't put it in those words. Well i'm gonna go. Thanks to all my friends, you keep me sane. ha love, bernadette&lt;/span>"},

The goal is not to bring peace to the Muslim world but a sword. The U.S. war machine is being used as a tool by New World Order proponents to bring about change to the entire Middle East. This can only be done if tensions are kept high in the Middle East and here in the U.S.. The photos and news coming out of Abu Ghraib prison serve to stir up emotions on one side, while the killing and mutilation of contractors in Feluja and the execution of Nick Berg keep the flames fueled here in the U.S.. We should be weary of not falling into this trap as U.S. citizens. Larger forces are at work that go far beyond the fighting in Iraq. This war was planned well in advance of 9/11. I suggest that the abuses in Abu Ghraib prison were orchestrated to be leaked to the public. And were most likley approved by Donald Rumsfeld if not higher, again to keep tensions high. The real story here if reported Will Not be what went on in the prisons but, like Watergate, will be the coverup going on at this time. The execution of Nick Berg most likley also had either U.S. consent or outright participation by the CIA."},

We stopped at the Cable Car Barn to see all the machinery that pulls the cable cars around, and then drove up to Muir Woods to see the redwoods.  I was surprised how close the redwoods were to downtown SF.  On the way back, we stopped and walked out on the Golden Gate Bridge as the sun set, which was really cool.  It looks a LOT bigger when you're standing on it, and it has a very nice view of downtown SF.  The hotel I'm in is right downtown, and an OK place, but walking at night around this neighborhood is probably not the best idea, though we did anyway last night just to see it.  Mike left last night to go back home, and now I'm officially here on business!

You know sometimes I got so much to say but usually I already tell you guys face to face. I like it how we always share things with one another and I enjoy letting you know what's happening in my life.&lt;br />&lt;br />I'm just so happy and grateful for having you all as my friends. Ahhhh the weird things that been happening lately! Freaks the shit out of me -raise eyebrow- Oh wellz I'm up for it!&lt;br />&lt;br />We can't stop what comes to us and when they come so unexpectedly. I would just deal them as they arise ^-^ Sheesh... The drama gosh! And I thought I won't have any this year and let the others particularly Margretta get the limelight but now it's otherwise.&lt;br />&lt;br />But no matter what you all are my greatest friends ever! I love you my ugly ducklings!&lt;br />&lt;br />You know you love me more though!&lt;/span>&lt;/div>"},
	{"id": "7003075", "title": "Praising Grace, but why? Interrogating Ephesians 1:6", "author": "Mark Lindsey", "date_created": "2015-01-13T07:50:00.001-05:00", "comment_count": 0, "post_url": "http://mark.lindsey.name/", "post_content": "&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>Ephesians 1:6&lt;/div>&lt;div>to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>1. What can we learn about all the good in Ephesians 1:4-5 by the statement that it is done \"to the praise of his glorious grace\"?&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>&lt;br>&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- If predestination, or adoption, or his will is interpreted to put God in a bad light, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- for example: if in explaining predestination you turn God into an unloving monster who makes children to die and burn in hell for eternity, and kind but ignorant, unevangelized pygmies who long for God but burn for never knowing the name Jesus, then YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; APPLICATION -- is the way and contexts that I talk about predestination, election, etc., TO THE PRAISE OF GOD's GRACE? Or is it argument? Divisive -- the insiders vs the unlearned? The pro-missions against the complacent?&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>2. \"With which he has blessed\" We have been blessed with Grace. Or is it \"blessed by grace?\" Or is it \"blessed using grace?\" What does that mean? Is it called glorious grace because of greatness of the blessing?&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- Ephesians 1:7 and 2:7 discuss \"riches of his grace\"&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>3. What does it mean to be blessed IN the beloved?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- It parallels being adopted as sons THROUGH Jesus&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- I suspect that there's a shade of difference in THROUGH Jesus vs IN Jesus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div>---- THROUGH Jesus might mean Jesus is a conduit to us&lt;/div>&lt;div>---- IN Jesus might mean our only existence is our union with Jesus&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- The difference is one of emphasis on our&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div>(a) blessings that come to us by way of Jesus, contrasted with&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div>(b) facts true of Jesus that become true of us when we are reconciled to Christ, and believe in him, and come to be IN Him.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Adoption as sons IN Jesus would make sense mostly of Jesus were adopted. But Adoption THROUGH Jesus can happen even though Jesus was begotten.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>4. Who is the beloved? Is it Jesus?&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes; see eph 1:8&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>5. What was intended to receive the praise discussed here?&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;gt;&amp;gt; His glorious grace&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>6. What events or actions were leading to the praise discussed here? (Options from Eph 1:5)&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>... maybe: purpose of his will&lt;/div>&lt;div>... maybe: adoption as sons through Jesus Christ&lt;/div>&lt;div>... maybe: he predestined us&lt;/div>&lt;div>... maybe: In love he acted&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- In any case, the action (I.e., the one that brought the praise to his glorious Grace) caused blessings IN the Beloved, Christ.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- Isaiah 43:21: God blesses and cares for the people he formed for himself SO THAT they will bring Him praise.&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- Isaiah 61:1-3,11: God grants freedom and deliverance and comfort and gladness SO THAT he will be glorified.&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- Jesus died to purchase righteousness and life! This is the reason The Father loves the son.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>7. Is \"blessed (\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03cc\u03c9 charito\u014d) in the beloved\" is a reference back to \"adoption as sons through Jesus Christ.\"?&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>... I.e., what was the blessing?&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- Romans 5:15-17. The free (charisma, and dorea) gift is righteousness that comes through an abundance of grace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- Ephesians 1:13. The Holy Spirit is another gift, the guarantee of their inheritance.&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- Colossians 1:13. The Father has transferred us from &amp;nbsp;the DOMAIN OF DARKNESS to the kingdom of his agape beloved Son!&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- 1 Timothy 1:13-14. Grace overflows bringing faith and love.&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- 1 Peter 2:9-10. We were not a people in the dark, and had received no mercy; but now we ARE a people, and not only a nation but a priesthood. And that is so we can proclaim the wonders of Him who brings us marvelous light!&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- Ephesians 1:7. Redemption through his blood. Forgiveness of trespasses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The blessings of being adopted and made IN Christ are numerous: forgiveness, righteousness, citizenship, a job, marvelous light, mercy, faith and love, TRANSFER from darkness, escape from the enemy kingdom, redemption from slavery, the right to proclaim God's goodness.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>8. Is the purpose of saying \"to the praise of his glorious grace with which he has blessed...\" is intended to establish that the glorious grace was integral in either the adoption, or to the predestining?&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- my best guess: the grace was integral in the adoption as sons&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- my best guess: the praise is triggered by his purpose, and his will, and his love, and his action of predestining us for adoption.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; therefore whatever it means to be \"predestined as sons for adoption\" it must also bring \"praise to his glorious grace\".&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>9. Are we blessed WITH praise, or blessed WITH grace? And if grace, what does it mean to be blessed WITH grace (charis)?&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- Philippians 3:9. We have a righteousness, and a share in His sufferings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- 1 Peter 2:5. We are like living stones building a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood to offer acceptable-to-God spiritual sacrifices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- Romans 3:22,26. We are justified to have righteousness of God, and that comes through faith in Jesus.&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- Romans 8:1. There is no condemnation to those IN Christ.&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- Could it be the praise we're blessed with? Although God's people will be attractive (Philippians 2:15 shine like stars, Daniel 12:3; Matthew 13:43 righteous will shine like the sun) that's probably not the main point here.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It seems most likely that the WITH refers to grace that brings pardon.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>10. Why is the grace itself praiseworthy, and not God himself?&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- 2 Corinthians 4:15. As grace extends to more and more people, that increases thanksgiving, and that brings glory to God.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- 1 Timothy 1:13-14. Grace overflows with faith and love.&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- Grace is like a beautiful river flowing from a mountain; we are blessed by drinking it and irrigating with it, and our hearts are drawn back to the source of the stream. The river flows with faith, and love, and it floods our land; and we know the mountain is even more beautiful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>11. Whatever is the the praise of his Glorious Grace here:&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>...in Ephesians 1:12, the first to hope would be to the praise of his Glory&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>...in Ephesians 1:14, your hearing and believing and sealing with the Holy Spirit is to the praise of his Glory&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>...so is there something essentially in common about the three praiseworthy things?&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;gt; hearing and believing and hoping and sealing and adopting and predestining are all part of the same package&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>12. What is the difference between \"blessed IN The Beloved\" here and \"adoption as sons THROUGH Jesus Christ\"?&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- blessedness isn't as powerful as adoption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;gt;&amp;gt; see 3.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>13. What's the significance of calling Jesus the beloved (\u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03c9 agapa\u014d)? Why not the title Christ again, or the pronoun \"him\"?&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- it helps answer the question of the object of love in Ephesians 1:4&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- it connects to Jesus' baptism, where he was called the beloved son, in whom God was well pleased. Matthew 3:17.&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- it becomes a name of Jesus.&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- John 3:35. God's love of the Son is linked with Jesus' authority and ownership of all things.&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- John 10:17. The reason that God loves the Son: because the son willingly lays down his life.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>14. When and how did God begin planning for his praise?&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- before the age began&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- before foundation of the world&lt;/div>&lt;div>-- God is strategic!&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;gt;&amp;gt; God had general objectives, specific plans, specific actions, to accomplish this end: praise of his glorious grace.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>15. Do I learn something about my need to plan and be strategic for God's glory?&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; APPLICATION. God has planned, had general desires, specific stated goals, specific actions for His plan. It was the way he worked from BEFORE THE DAWN OF TIME. I only have a few years to live on earth: how is my planning going? What are my stated, explicit goals? What are my concrete actions? What steps am I taking to ensure my efforts auger to the PRAISE OF HIS GLORIOUS GRACE and not some other prestige for myself?&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br>&lt;/div>"},

Getting started was a major problem, as every time the project seemed to be getting momentum, something would come up and derail it.&lt;br />&lt;br />The project just never would have happened at all if not for the people I've been working with. I first approached Lee Willet about playing the Bad Seed, who was then just known as \"the villain.\" I knew Lee from a broadcasting class the year before. I knew he had a lot of acting experience, I knew he had a steadily flowing imagination and he just seemed like he'd be a lot of fun to work with. &lt;br />&lt;br />Joe Erdkamp, who plays The Samaritan, was basically my only option for the hero. Joe is huge and gets mistaken for The Rock - so he's obviously perfect physically to play a superhero - but like Lee, he had experience acting and just had the perfect attitude and imagination to help me figure out the movie.&lt;br />&lt;br />Rounding out the list is Scott Eastman, who I guess could be considered art director.  I knew roughly what I was looking for as far as the basics of costumes and whatnot, but once Scott cut loose, he put together far cooler costumes than I imagined using the most mundane things. The costumes are kind of like sculptures, I suppose - he's making interesting things out of materials that really have no business being used that way.&lt;br />&lt;br />Anyway, brainstorming and bouncing ideas and receiving ideas from these three has been a more educational and helpful experience than I could really put into words. When I first got the idea for this movie, I was really excited about it and thought it was a cool story, but it would be nothing like what it's going to be without the hard work and the input of these guys. Obviously you don't have a movie if you don't have the main actors, but this movie would never have been started if not for the persistence of these guys, making me get my act together.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;img class=\"right\" align=\"right\" src=\"http://www.cheeksofgod.com/joe.jpg\" />&lt;br />It hasn't been easy. The first shoot, during which more than 20 people donated 3-4 hours of their time, was almost a complete waste. The main camera malfunctioned and none of the footage was salvageable. A behind-the-scenes camera caught a good portion of the action, and pieces of that will be used, but nowhere near the extent I hoped for when visualizing that first scene.&lt;br />&lt;br />The story revolves around four main scenes - the first one I just mentioned, an indoor scene in the Bad Seed's apartment, a second fight scene and then the grand finale. One of our group brainstorming sessions spawned the idea of fleshing out some more backstory, adding a flashback scene as well.&lt;br />&lt;br />In some ways, it was getting to be too big, but different ways of approaching what needed to be shot were making it surprisingly manageable. It's hard to really give examples without giving away parts of the movie, but I can say that there are going to be aspects of this movie beyond the cast and costumes that will look really high-budget, except the casual viewer hopefully won't even notice them as special effects.&lt;br />&lt;br />Well Joe decided, after years of thinking about it, to finally move to California. And that gave us a deadline to shoot the rest of Joe's parts. So yesterday, we started about 3:00 and shot til around midnight, getting pieces of the first scene, pieces of the final scene, and pieces of the flashback. It's going to be amazing if the editing actually works out and everything pieces together just right.&lt;br />&lt;br />Shooting last night, I was thinking about how probably the best part of this, beyond just getting to hang out with these people and make something with them, was watching the ideas and the project evolve with everyone's input. &lt;br />&lt;br />\"Felt\" was a fun movie to make, but you don't learn a lot from working with puppets and Josh Harrison's right hand."},

What a shame to jeopardize that. &lt;br />&lt;br />Apparently there is a video of his comments, taken by the Davos Forum people; but no one can see it. Some wonder why Jordan would resign, claiming his words were misinterpretted, before anyone could view the tape and make an informed decision, potentially to his benefit. &lt;br />&lt;br />The &lt;a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17462-2005Feb11.html\">WaPo&lt;/a> is refreshingly upfront about the blog role in Jordan's rapid demise, stating it directly in the second paragraph of a long, 15 paragraph story:&lt;blockquote>&lt;em>Even as he said he had misspoken at an international conference in suggesting that coalition troops had \"targeted\" a dozen journalists and insisted he never believed that, Jordan was being pounded hourly by bloggers, liberal as well as conservatives, who provided the rocket fuel for a story that otherwise might have fizzled.&lt;/blockquote>&lt;/em>&lt;em>Ha!&lt;/em> Wonder why it \"otherwise might have fizzled\"; maybe because the journalists who should have jumped on the story would have ignored it? Only if they were liberal and agreed with Jordan, I suppose. Suffice to say there has been ample reporting on this from the &lt;a href=\"http://billroggio.com/easongate/archives/2005/02/the_price_of_sl.php#comments\">blogs&lt;/a>, which don't suffer the same occupational lethargy. &lt;a href=\"http://www.hughhewitt.com/#postid1369\">Hugh Hewitt&lt;/a> has been at the forefront of this expose, and still is.

I was busy reading other books..&lt;br />*if you're planning on reading it, then the rest of this post might be a slight spoiler*&lt;br />&lt;br />Good book, interesting premise, annoying storyline.. the ideas in the book were new to me, to be honest.. I always percieved the \"Holy Grail\" to be a wooden cup of Jesus, like in Indy Jones.. you know, the one where it ends in the dumb Nazis going for the craziest chalice with the most bling and end up dying and shit..&lt;br />&lt;br />Anyway, that's besides the point.. what I wanted to go on about today was more than just the concept of the \"chalice\" or the \"grail\" as stated in the book.. all that historical relic stuff was all interesting and fitted well in the framework of the story (which I found annoyingly stop/start, as though the author intended to make the job of the screenplay writer a lot easier when importing it onto the big screen).. what struck me most was the book's insight into the symbolism and ideas of \"the sacred feminine\"..&lt;br />&lt;br />Makes you stop and think, don't it? Jesus had a wife and kids? The Da Vinci painting of \"the last supper\" showing his wife, Mary Magdalene, sitting next to him on the table along with all the other apostles? Now, I'm a muslim myself so I'm not taking this in any religious aspect, simply commenting on what I've read and seen as a human being. Might be simplistic, might be wrong or skewed.. but I don't want a shitload of comments delving into religious or moral issues.. this is a simple blog written by a simple man who's talking about a simple idea..&lt;br />&lt;br />Men and women complementing each other.&lt;br />&lt;br />The belief present in males that they can control the destiny of the human race unassisted is quite unfortunate. Males tend to be physically stronger, tend to be more aggressive in nature. Taking that as a whole and looking at the current political and cultural climate in the world, you can see a dangerous route of destruction and bloodshed ahead. Political ideologies at war, and who are the politicans in the highest echelons of power? Men. Religions at war, and who are the clerics, priests and rabbis with the most influence? Men.&lt;br />&lt;br />It seems that without the counterbalance of the female, male ego and ambition for power can run unchecked and lead the whole race to self-destruction. If females dominated the world in the exact reverse situation, the world would be going to shit for reasons I can't even begin to fathom. The whole system is fucked if power and control lay in the hands of one sex.&lt;br />&lt;br />Unfortunately, current cultural and religious beliefs tend to predominantely state that women are an inferior sex, and must be treated as such. Even in the so-called \"civilized world\", women are still struggling for their full rights. Granted, they might have their basic rights given back to them as opposed to places like Saudi Arabia where they are treated like glorified animals.. but that touches on my main point: Why is it that men are GIVING women those rights? Its less a case of giving than giving BACK. How come those rights were taken away to begin with; and why and when did this happen? When did the yang decide to dispose of the yin and run the show? Doesn't it know that without its other half it no longer represents a whole circle, instead it just looks like a stupid piece of turd?&lt;br />&lt;br />My questions are simply a matter of observation, a matter of logic.&lt;br />&lt;br />Alright, back to work for me. Maybe next time I'll write about the state of my freezer or something more docile. All this thinking makes my head hurt."},

I really enjoyed writing many of the papers--the research assignment evoking some pretty strong feelings and allowing me to vent a little. I love being creative and writing what I feel, and this is where I hope to take my writing. Literature is great and all, and I love critiquing different novels and stories, but I really love writing about things that spark my fire like talk shows, society, the future, and history. Arguing has always been my strong suit, so I guess I should take some sort of persuasive or argumentation course to further develop my ideas and strategies (I have heard about the argumentation IGETC course on campus\u2014no way). I know that I tended to be one heck of a pessimistic person all semester, but I really do have a passion for life and I really do love talk shows and some reality TV (surprise, surprise!). As Jerry Springer leaves with a final thought, so will I: English isn\u2019t bad once it\u2019s over. Sure it was hard, but it was fun. I am really proud of everything I have written and look forward to more research papers\u2014not!"},

The 5 course was only available for parties of 2 or more at $150. I also had an excellent bottle of German Spatlese Riesling for $60. The muse was a vegetable shooter, which was much better than I anticipated given its description. For the first course, I picked foie gras two ways. &lt;em>(Imagine that:-)&lt;/em> One of the two ways was foie gras soup in a shot glass with a straw. Unusual serving method, and delicious at the same time. The second way was served more traditionally on the same plate. For the second and main course, I chose the recommended Dorade, a fish, with skin on, which typically I would strip off, but it was of such find preparation that I did not need to. For the final desert course, I chose a rhubarb pastry. The rhubarb had been blanched, removing much of it's tartness but preserving it's unique flavor. Additonally, a finally plate was brought with a few small desert items on it that I could not finish. All in all a spectacular evening."},

If someone could not be trusted, they were consideredworthless, so it was a killing matter to defame anyone publicly. &lt;/p>&lt;p>I can think of a couple of Senators who should be called out by President Bush. Six shooters at twenty paces. People would be a little more careful about what they say publicly and the Republicans would gain a few seats in the Senate.&lt;/p>"},

So basic is this belief, the Framers of our Constitution made it crystal clear, via the First Amendment, that the freedoms of speech, religion, the press and association were not to be compromised by governmental intervention or legislation. Or so they thought. The clarity they intended has evolved into a murky swamp beset with lawsuits and court decisions which confuse any attempt at reasoned analysis of the issue.&lt;br />&lt;br />An absolutist would contend that all speech should be protected to preserve the right of the citizenry to project their ideas and opinions into the arena of debate. While the thought of censoring pure speech-political speech-is despicable, not all speech should share the same protection and certain limits on speech are necessary to preserve order in society. Three forms of speech are not protected by the First Amendment. Obscenity, deals with expression that appeal to the prurient interests and has no social or redeeming value. The \"fighting words\" or those words that arouse a passion in an individual where imminent danger or violence is at hand. And defamation, where an individual is libeled or slandered. But agreement on the elements that constitute each of these is not set in stone.&lt;br />&lt;br />One of the least protected areas of free speech is that which involves public broadcasting. While federal statutes prohibit any form of censorship in television and radio programming prior to a broadcast, Congress and the courts have awarded the Federal Communications Commission the authority to determine what is \"indecent\" as broadcast and effectively suppressed expression. Once placed on notice that a broadcast is deemed \"indecent\", the broadcaster faces fines or a notation in their file that may weigh heavily on their attempt to renew their license. A subtle form of censorship so expressly forbidden under the law?&lt;br />&lt;br />But what constitutes the moniker of \"indecent\"? The Supreme Court held that the term applies to the \"nonconformance to the accepted standards of morality\". In this day and age, what is the accepted standards of morality? The present administration has set its own standard on everything from abortion to gay marriages. Even children's shows such as Barney and SpongeBob Squarepants have taken hits from the moral right who attempts to save us from ourselves. For a governmental agency to have such power as to subjectively conclude what is decent or not flies in the face of what freedom of expression actually means.&lt;br />&lt;br />A Supreme Court decision, &lt;em>FCC v. Pacifica Foundation&lt;/em>, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) upheld the superfluous powers of the FCC. A monologue by George Carlin, a famous and talented satirist and comedian, entitled \"Dirty Words\" (\"7 Dirty Words\") was aired on a radio station out of New York in the early afternoon hours. A man driving in his car with his son heard the broadcast and complained to the FCC that this was not the kind of programming that he and his son should not be subjected to this type of indecency. The FCC sent a letter of complaint to the station and though not sanctioning the station advised that further complaints would be taken under advisement once renewal of the license of the station was at hand.&lt;br />&lt;br />A brief summation: Obscenity not at issue. Indecency at issue. Children involved. Afternoon when children are present. FCC can determine what you can or can not hear. No censorship. Captive audience. This was the opinion of the majority. You read the dissenting opinions and you decide who has the most reasoned analysis. Note while you do, that the monologue is only 12 minutes long and that the adult driving the car presumably had the capacity to hit another button. As an aside, the complaint by the dad in the Carlin case was the only complaint received.&lt;br />&lt;br />Each morning on my way to work, I listen to a radio program, The Bob and Tom Show. Very entertaining, contemporary and at times promote debate on current issues through their satirical offerings. Not really for the timid or weak of heart. When my children were younger, we listened to the program while in the car together. Many times we laughed until we cried. If there was a question concerning what was said, I never shied away from an explanation. When I participated in the carpool and the backseat was filled with giggly little high school girls, I controlled the on/off switch. There was no captive audience who after listening to something for five minutes, then makes a moral decision to use their finger to find another channel.&lt;br />&lt;br />But station owners have become hesitant to air programming that may run afoul of the FCC guidelines, whether real or imagined censure would be forthcoming. While we can't call FCC actions truly censorship, the words of a Supreme Court Justice ring in my ears. \"I know it, when I see it\""},

My family was a big one there were many days when the tree was full of children. My grand mother had nine children as well as rasing me from the age of two. From the time  I was old enough to remember on sundays the house and yard was filled with sounds of many people. My Grand Mother would cook chicken gumbo, potato salad, pot roast, corn, beans of some kind and a dessert.All of her children would come after church with their families and we would  eat laugh and play the rest of the day. This is the way it was with most people in Evan's Creek families would get together after church on sundays. Stay tuned more later. "},

I am so exhausted from work. I had to be at Hannaford for 8 - 1:30 came home rested actually took a nap. Then up an at it again to Dairy Queen 6 - 10. Moppin' floors sucks so much my arm is like goin' to rip off. Mcas is next week I am so not happy about that. I can't take test for the life of me.. I'm just horrible at it. But I hope I will be able to get into the Charter School. I know it will be so much better for me .. but no one else seems to think the same. My school is cool an shit I have met alot of kick ass people there but I just don't do well what so ever. I need like 1 on 1 help ya know. So I barely like hang out with anyone since I have the two jobs which sucks. My body like is havin' a hard time functionin' cause I am so weak. The reason why I have both is because I have bills up the ass to pay for. My car is like the biggest so far. I just need to take a moment to breathe or scream .... Every second of the day theres always something to do or on my mind. It's so aggravatin' when you feel like theres no self control what so ever. I try to make time for friends but mostly SLEEP...!! Which I should be doin' now but I have a hard time doin' it. I am listenin' to the new Hanson cd pretty good I must say. This is like my favorite time of night.. It's where I can just relax not have to worry about a god damn thing. When I hear certain songs I start to remember certain things.. certain person I should say. Somebody I really need to just get over. It's so hard cause I miss him so much he really did hurt me... but doesn't know how much I truly cared. It sucks when you just try to move on but knowin' that they will haunt you forever. I guess all I can do is think about somethin' else. Let's see I am sorta gettin' along with my cousins which is good we talk alot now. I guess all three of us are finally growin' out. Passin' the true immature stages that we all went through cause I remember we would always yell an scream at one another. Now we can actually conversate. I really do miss my family... My grandma an little cousin will be here in two weeks... so my mom is fixin' up the whole basement.. I might move down there later this year. I will be 18 how I wish I could get a place of my own. But for now I just need to concentrate at whats at hand all the problems I need to prioritize my life... Ya I am going to a therapist dude... It's all good hey they are going to help me straighten everything out right?!! Goin' to go crash into my bed talk to ya later man.."},

This is disappearing in those moments and hording this delicious distraction so intensely, I'm frozen.  This, is his kiss.  Where do I vanish to in this glow of oxytocin?  I know I'm gone and I just don't want to do anything about it.  Will he call?  When?  WHEN!?  And, I feel ridiculous for even having this internal conversation with myself...on paper for Godsakes.  What do I really want anyway?  I want there to be a man so intense, so under my skin, I, and the world just fall away.  And yet, this is exactly what I don't want.  To be lost in a sea of boy.  They leave.  They find a reason to leave.  Or I will.  The distraction will make life so unbelievably unbearable I will have to go.  I will fade into a fog of emotional torment and then be sick.  This was just supposed to be sex.  Fun.  Brief.  Then, someone started to feel.  Someone started to notice this was good and ruined everything.  But, my girlfriends.  Help me dear girls.  Remind me of my worth.  Remind me of my value and my happiness and my dreams.  And tell me I am not lost.  I'm just lost in love.&lt;br />"},

I guess \"life\" can't really throw anything; ok, rephrase \"God allows funny things to happen.\" For example: I auditioned for one acts last night. Miss Big-Head Theatre Junkie was not worried about getting into a show but when i first looked this morning, five of the nine had been posted and i had not been cast. Maybe i'm not such a big shot after all! However, when i looked at lunch, I had been cast as \"Mabel\" the ditzy girlfriend. Now this is the funny part. My boyfriend \"the repairman\" is none other than the guy my dearest cousin dated last year, the guy who thinks that I \"shot him mean looks\" and \"hate\". First of all, that is completely bogus. I do not hate anyone and i can assure you that if he thinks that i shoot mean looks then all my looks must be mean because i do NOT alter the expression on my face when i see him. Ha. I have no idea what my role is going to be like, aside from the fact that my character was described as overly optimistic. Does anyone else notice that i don't EVER the role of a normal human being? I love it! I wouldn't want to play those anyway. I actually avoided auditioning for the serious shows, something i've never done before. So yeah, i'll be playing the girlfriend of my cousin's former boyfriend. This is bound to be exciting. &lt;br />&lt;br />I also realized that it's rather humorous that i refused to read the love advice book my mother brought home for me yesterday when just a few days ago i said that i was going to write my own love advice book. Maybe the author of \"Stupid Things...etc etc\" just wanted to vent off some steam about love gone amock too. However i still will not read her book, despite the fact that it's supposed to be really good, a best seller, blah blah blah. Lady, i've had enough advice given to me that i could sit and write a book myself. Yes, life is full of humor if we only take the time to sit and think about it."},

It is in the men's room at the Dakota. It is ubiquitous. The music never stops. You're OK at first but even those with relatively good mental health are eventually reminded of or re-live every minor and major disappointment of some previous Christmas or every loss associated with a special person no longer with us. If one Christmas carol doesn't get you another one eventually does. There is no escape. Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated. There is no escape from Christmas. You will never have enough money to deal with it. You will never be broke enough to be removed from it. You will never be able to hide from it. Christmas is all around you.You will not make new Christmas memories with the exception of particularly nasty December events, like a terrorist attack or a newly discovered attempted genocide somewhere in some country whose name you cannot pronounce.

First, we will be doing a debate on line, this is something that is new to me, and it sounds as though it will be alot of fun. The second thing I found interesting about the course is the Blog assignment. This is the first time that I have heard of this and I am trying to make sure that I comprehend it fully. Over all I believe I am going to enjoy this summer semester course. "},

I just saw the last \"Call For Help\" on Tech TV. Now I know what I last wrote about concerning change, and let me state that my position on change has not \"changed\". That having been said, I see this change as sad, mainly because I don't believe taking Call For Help off the air was a wise move. Now before I go further let me state here and now that I have never worked in TV. So I don't understand all that goes into these types of decisions. HOWEVER, I have watched many hours of television in my life and I know what I like and what others have told me they like. I think that if G4TechTV is to survive, it needs to bring together the best of both networks. That also means providing programming for a wider number of people. Call for Help was of great help to the newbie computer user as well as helping those more advanced with problems that we just can not seem to get our head around. Now that the new owners have seen fit to remove that help, I wonder how many devotees of the show will not stick around to see the new network. If they don't, that will be a loss not only to them but to the new network. &lt;b> OK enough of the missed opportunity segment. What I really wanted to say is \"thank you to everyone who brought us Call For Help!\" I hope that you all know how much you have helped us all over the years. I would start calling names but then I would forget someone and I do not want to do that. You all touched our lives in many ways from keeping us in touch with one another and our families to making sure these \"personal confusers\" do not get the best of us. You showed us cool websites and where to get free stuff. You taught us how to take better pictures and how to fix our little mishaps behind camera and on the keyboard. We called you to get us through the scrapes we got ourselves into and you were always there with answers. Personally though, you gave me the courage at 37 to pick a new career path for my second career. I am currently going back to school so I can start a job in the movie and gaming industry. It is ironic that I start down this new path that you helped me pick just as you are taken off the air. I wanted you all to know however that you all had a part in showing me that I can do take this path. Thank you all so much for all you have done. "},

Yes, nipple burn, this is what I want to talk about.  Around a week ago I went to the gym and wore this soccer jersey that I have and (much to my dismay) the material from the shirt gave me fabric burn right on my nipples.  And it was not comfortable.  Seriously, this is unpleasant experience and the silence needs to be broken.  Things worsened today when I wore a different shirt to the gym and the combination of the material, sweat and running actually caused bleeding.  It soaked through my shirt and made me abort my stretching session out of panic.  I wasn't so freaked out about people noticing, I was worried about what I may have actually done to a sensitive part of the human body.  There was a moment when I actually pictured a mangled nipple staring back at me for the rest of my life.  What did people do when polyester was the norm?  Did they just live through the pain?  Why can't all clothes be really soft?  Is this not something that we should be striving for as a society, not just equality amongst people and balanced existence with the planet, but also really soft clothing.  Seriously think about it.  Wouldn't you like to be swaddled in soft cotton and in slippers throughout the day?  We would all know what it Hugh Hefner lives like but without the selling of women's bodies on our consciousness.

Yes, its one week here and then a few days in Belgium for me. I have been strangely relaxed here considering I dont speak French well and I dont know my way around. But I groove with the rythym of city life - its nice to depend on public transportation and to walk. People have been very nice, so far I have not met one stereotypical scornful French person, everyone has been so nice to me and actually apologetic. &lt;br />&lt;br />Yesterday I walked around the Latin Quarter taking in Notre Dame, the Louvre and Hotel De Ville. The Hotel was special to me because I used to like the famous Doisneau photograph of the couple kissing in front of it. Notre Dame and the Louvre gave me great photos. Being a tourist exhausts me so today I wanted to catch up on my favorite stores that I used to go to in NY. Funnily enough, after all that saving up for this, I found nothing that I wanted.  Oh dear, maybe I'm getting older! xoxoxo"},

This time I'm not going to worry so much about trying anything specific, I am just going to use this blog as a tool to get my brain rolling every day and clear out and untangle some of the various threads that are always rattling around aimlessly in my bean.&lt;br />&lt;br />Today started with a random genealogical quest to discover something of the origins and ultimates fates of a CHARLES IVES who settled in Barbados in 1680. I was only aware of one Ives in Barbados, namely the aforementioned Charles, but it appears there were also a John, Peter, James and Urania, possibly all siblings or some variety of cousins to each other. If any Ives from Barbados end ups reading this send me a line...&lt;br />&lt;br />So now I start poking around again and already I am reshuffling my previous assumptions. Barbados is &lt;span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_0\">divided&lt;/span> into &lt;span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_1\">parishes&lt;/span>, and we find Charles and Peter in St. Michael, John and James are in St. Philip, Urania in Christ Church. This makes it less likely they are all one family, though anything is possible. Christ Church borders on St. Michael's parish on the south so maybe Urania is connected to Charles and Peter. Saint Philip is on the south-east tip of Barbados, Christ Church parish borders it on the west.&lt;br />&lt;br />Barbados come under English rule in 1625. I think out of all the areas that the British established plantations Barbados had the highest percentage of slaves versus free whites and so was became an unattractive destination for poor white emigrants, plus the climate and other factors contributed to a very high mortality rate for new arrivals. The majority of the white population on Barbados in the 1600s were either very wealthy planters, or the poor whites mostly indentured servants, the British small-holders being squeezed out by the large plantation estates and either emigrating to surrounding islands in the Caribbean, or to North and South Carolina, Panama, or British Guiana.&lt;br />&lt;br />Next we Have a Richard Ives emigrating to Nevis, now with Saint &lt;span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_2\">Kitts&lt;/span>, The Federation of Saint &lt;span class=\"blsp-spelling-error\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_3\">Kitts&lt;/span> and Nevis. 1620 beginning of English &lt;span class=\"blsp-spelling-corrected\" id=\"SPELLING_ERROR_4\">sovereignty&lt;/span>. Beginning of settlement by British in 1628 by Anthony Hilton and 80 followers, plus another hundred from London. Richard Ives came to Nevis in 1654.&lt;br />&lt;br />I'll return to these at a later date.&lt;br />&lt;br />The rest of day has been spent reading Tigers in the Snow by Peter Mathiessen and Maurice Hornocker (Also heartily recommend Of Tigers and Men by Richard Ives - and any biographical information on this Richard would be appreciated). To me Peter Mathiessen and another naturalist friend of his Geroge B. Schaller have among the most interesting lives possible - roaming around the wilds of the world (or what is left of them) and observing animals. Any excuse to wander around Siberia, Mongolia or Central Asia is a good one I think. Even better if somebody funds you to do it.&lt;br />&lt;br />Also procured a couple of the new editions of the Flashman Papers by George Macdonald Fraser and a couple more in Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe's series so overall a pretty good day."},

I guess I definitely posted way to soon. First of all, I felt as if I lost, but in the end, Fate dealt me a royal flush. Therefore, I win. Lol. Maybe some explanation is needed.&lt;br />&lt;br />I met this guy at Village Inn named Nick. He had moved here from Cedar Rapids and had become a regular. Well, I ended up giving him my number and I got his and we sorta hooked up. We we're sorta going out as friends (or rather, acquaintances). Well, we had some late nights together (don't let your imagination take you too far with that statement). Anywho, he's bi and I kinda realized all of this, but didn't truly accept it. Well, when he's gay, I win. However, if a hot chick comes along, I lose. I guess though he's only gay when he's single, bored, and/or horny. Yea. Now he doesn't talk to me. I haven't really tried to talk to much to him, but I'd still like to remain friends. Plus, he owes me about forty bucks or so. The day I typed the \"I lose\" posting, was the day I officially knew it was over, but he was also planning to go back to Cedar Rapids (never to come back). Needless to say, he's still in Omaha, but I still never talk to him.&lt;br />&lt;br />Well, after Weslyan, which was loads of fun (Michael's crazy and Lily's talented at being blonde, and Joe's.... Joe), but I was covering someone's shift Saturday night. Well, I met Nate. He goes to Valley, he's really cute, he's gay, he likes me. And we've started to hang out. We also have the \"psycho-path overachiever/doing-something-all-the-time\" aspect in common as well. But, sadly, I'm an insomniac and he's not. Not a huge loss. Anywho, so that's cool. I guess, overall, this weekend was nice. We have school off on Thursday, Friday, and Monday so that's something to look forward to. All I have to do is survive three days (unfortunately, that includes work every night, precalc test tomorrow that im no where near ready for, french test, and a japanese presentation). Well. we'll see what happens. Until next time....&lt;br />&lt;br />-Aaron B."},

Here is what i found out: I found out that fairies are actually gay people from new york that formed a clan and dressed up in princess suits and shrunk themself with jetpacks! how gay is that. The craziest part about fairies is that they are everywere, there are even soup fairies that hide in your soup and bagels. Next time you tase something soupy in your bagel just know that it is a soup fairy that is lost in the space of time. Anyway there is no cure for fairyness and if you know a fairy tou should call me so i can pee on them and go home happy."},

I restricted the Airave service to my cell phone because I'm the one paying for the high-speed Internet and I always want to insure that I have the service when I need or want it (the device can only handle three phones at once).&lt;br />&lt;br />When you restrict access, the unit, according to Page 33 of the manual, is to do this: \"When unauthorized callers within range of the base station attempt to place a call, they are automatically redirected to the near cell tower.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />However, the unit does not work according to the manual. If Virgin Mobile and Sprint users are close enough to the Airave, their phones will lock onto the Airave and be unable to make or receive calls -- without notice.&lt;br />&lt;br />I learned this the hard way. A friend with Virgin Mobile was visiting and expecting a call. No call came. He wondered if the phone worked and tried to make a call. He got the message that he was connected to a Sprint Private Network and was told to move out of the area. A neighbor with two Sprint phones (personal and business) told me one day that her Sprint service had stopped working.&lt;br />&lt;br />The result: the neighbor blamed me, not Sprint, for interfering with her phone service.&lt;br />&lt;br />Note this language in Sprints Terms and Conditions:&lt;br />&lt;br />\"You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from any claims arising out of your actions, including, but not limited to, failing to provide appropriate notices regarding location-sensitive services (see \"Location Based Services\" section), failure to safeguard your passwords, backup question to your shared secret question or other account information, or violating this Agreement, any applicable law or regulation or the rights of any third party.\"&lt;br />&lt;br />What this means:&lt;br />&lt;br />-- if a neighbor sues Sprint because of my action of buying and installing an Airave that disrupts the neighbor's service and any untoward results, I'm on the hook for all of Sprint's legal defense bills.&lt;br />&lt;br />-- if a neighbor sues me because of my action of buying and installing an Airave that disrupts the neighbor's service and any untoward results, I cannot go to Sprint for reimbursement of legal bills.&lt;br />&lt;br />Either way, just one lawsuit could wipe you out financially, whether just or not, whether it goes anywhere or not.&lt;br />&lt;br />My legal counsel advised me to terminate my Airave service to avoid liability problems. I took the advice and returned the unit."},

About a week and a half later I graduated Summa Cum Laude from the program and began my quest to find a job as a professional pilot.  Many of the regional airlines are in a hiring frenzy.  All of my concerns, suspicions, and doubts are being refuted and for the first time (as far as I know) my timing has been impeccable.&lt;br />&lt;br />Just a couple days ago I interviewed with Atlantic Southeast Airlines.  They are a wholly owned subsidiary for Delta and operate as Delta Connection.  I hoped, but never really thought that I would be in a position to fly for an airline after only 250 hours of flight training.  Mind you, each one of those hours are high quality training hours and I believe that I am prepared to move on as a professional pilot.  At the same time I feel very lucky to be in my position and am delighted to have the opportunity to work for a classy operation.  Sometime this week I'll find out the results of my interview.  Secretly, as I do not want to jinx myself, I feel confident that I will get an acceptance letter and move to Atlanta to start my new life.  Until then I an going to visit my cousin after he has been in the hospital for a month from his car accident.  He is doing much better but I'll be happy to see him and the rest of the family."},

I think God's wish is to just kill everyone I love dearly.  First Nate last month, then Brandon Sturdy, now my Grandma.  Man, I love her, she was such a doll.  And now she's gone.  I miss her completely with my heart.  Tonight is the visitation and I'm a little nervous.  I haven't cried yet, most likely 'cause I don't want to accept another death.  But if I don't cry at the visitation I'll prolly wonder what's wrong.  Am I out of tears?  I know I ran out of them at Boone, and have been empty of them since.  I just can't stop thinking, why are so many people dying all of a sudden?  Is God trying to tell me that it's that time to start letting things go and go into the future?  Who knows.  I'm just out of it.  In and out of reality, you might say.  *hugs* Liz"},

I left as a corporate employee, single, glamorous and ambitious and I came back a healer, not glamorous, caring much less about ambitions and much more interested in the realms of love.&lt;br />&lt;br />A group of Minnesota women and I spent time with my family, and then we visited Casablanca before heading south to Marrakech. We had the privilege to visit the biggest mosque in the world -- Hassan II Mosque -- which was built half on land and half on the sea. It is a jewel of Moroccan architecture. The first day in Marrakech, some of us visited the ancient part of the city, which is colorful, rich and abundant with merchandise of all kinds: spices, olives, almonds, pottery, brass ornaments, carpets, clothing, shoes and much more. We walked all morning and finally stopped to have lunch in a two-story restaurant on the roof overlooking the ancient place of Jamaa El Fenaa. Oh, the food was among the greatest enjoyments of the lands of Morocco. Mostly grown organicly, the food was served in much smaller portions, but it was so tasty. It was the middle of the day. The temperature was hot, yet feeling good.&lt;br />&lt;br />The following day we traveled to Essaouira, the blue and white pearl of the Moroccan Atlantic coast, the city of silver, thuia wood, where you can enjoy the fish caught early in the morning for lunch! The Festival of Gnawa Music was taking place, and the city was full of visitors and artists from all over the world. Five big stages set up in different parts of town held free and open shows. The whole city was in a magical trance and the music was playing everywhere. It almost felt like one big heartbeat, and that beat stayed with me for almost two months after I returned to Minnesota. The people were dancing in the streets and there was so much joy and happiness. I realized afterward that during this whole tour I was not afraid, nor were the women with me. In fact, they sometimes stayed outside walking and shopping all by themselves until 2 in the morning. &lt;br />&lt;br />Morocco is filled of sacred, fascinating and mystical places. However, the most sacred, powerful one that affected me the most is the kindness and the warmth of the people of Morocco. The women attending the retreat and I made wonderful connections with the people we encountered. We were helped, taken care of and overly spoiled by almost everyone: my family members, the Sufi Meditation Women's group, the hotel workers, restaurants waiters and mostly everyone we encountered! &lt;br />&lt;br />Because I am from Morocco, I am not quiet sure if I forgot or if I ever appreciated what I had when I lived there. But this trip, despite all the responsibilities I had as a retreat leader, was the most magnificient traveling experience I have ever had! &lt;br />-- Najat Fares Kessler, Minneapolis&lt;br />Published on Edge Life on February, 2005. http://www.edgenews.com/issues/2005/02/postcard.html"},

They're affordable and for the most part, they are reliable. But sometimes, they have a hint of retardism.&lt;br />&lt;br />Just my luck, I'm currently living in apartment unit 2O. That's TWO-letter O. Not twenty. I've had problems before when I was setting up our cable internet. When I called in my appointment, the technician over the phone said, \"I'm not seeing your apartment... oh 2_O.\" It was inevitable that the USPS would make the same mistake. A few months ago, I ordered a textbook to be sent to me. After 3-4 weeks after the purchase, the seller emailed me that the book was sent back to him... stamped on the package \"Return to Sender, Address Undeliverable.\" The 2nd attempt was successful. And now... I somehow get mail delivered correctly with only \"Apt 2\" on it and no O nor zero. Amazing.&lt;br />&lt;br />The Righteous Brother also received a miracle delivery. On the envelope, the street address was off... correct number but a street name that did not resemble his whatsoever. And yet, they found him correctly! How?!?!&lt;br />&lt;br />And my classic encounter at the post office a couple of years ago. I attempted to mail a book via media mail. And the clerk refused to give me media mail rate. Her exact reasons for refusing it to me:&lt;br />&lt;ol>   &lt;li>The book is not heavy enough, and thus doesn't qualify for media mail.&lt;/li>   &lt;li>The book is paperback, and only hardcover books are real books and qualify for media mail.&lt;/li>   &lt;li>It only had 200 pages, and that doesn't qualify as a book.&lt;br />  &lt;/li> &lt;/ol> I find it hard to believe that this worker knows what a &lt;i>real&lt;/i> book looks like.  She had the most ridiculous definitions of a book. [FYI, the novel was \"Beowulf\"]"},

My subject registration is approximately 10.5 hours away!! I am a bit nervous. I really want to get the slots that I planned. It is by far the most suitable. Usually I plan my timetable in such a way that the beginning of the week is slogging time (and i mean slog. My mondays and tuesdays are planned to begin at 830am and end at 430pm and 730pm respectively, with only an hour break in between reserved for lunch), leaving the last 3 weekdays of my week relatively free. Maybe I really am the \"get-over-and-done-with\" kind of person. \u5148\u82e6\u540e\u751c. Haha!&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;color:#33ccff;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;color:#33ccff;\">Anyway, one of the reasons I need my timetable to go according to plan is because of my new tuition assignments. I really do not want them to stress me out too much when I am already overloading my academic subjects. Whatsmore, I still do not have a hall. Hostel applications, according to the students' affairs office of my campus, will only be opened during the first weeks of January. My home isn't exactly near from campus, which means I need to travel at least 1.5 hrs to school and back. My, will I be dead tired.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;color:#33ccff;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;color:#33ccff;\">Well, I have temporarily moved to my brother's old room. There will be some renovations in my house's toilets beginning tomorrow. My room would not be spared of all the dirt and noise, so I guess it's best this way... besides, my internet connection became damn good..(73%!! Can you believe it??) &lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;color:#33ccff;\">MUAHAHAHAHA!!!!&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;color:#33ccff;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;color:#33ccff;\">OH YAR!

Even though I always sneak food in, I get this paranoid feeling just as I hand in my tickets, as if somehow the ticket taker is going to strip search me. So we're walking in the theater, and that feeling comes over me. Then I notice the ticket taker is a lady in a wheelchair, who had what appeared to be cerebral palsy. For a brief moment, my thought was, \"Good, she won't be worried about our snacks.\" Immediately, I felt like the biggest jerk in the entire world. I was at that moment. I was more worried about saving a few bucks on concessions, than I was about this person who has the guts to get out there in the working world, despite a serious disability. Hell, many healthy adults don't have what it takes to get a job, and this woman did. Looking back, not only do I feel like a jerk (still!) for that brief thought, but I also feel great respect for this person. Not only that, but I learned a valuable lesson that day. "},

	{"id": "7004453", "title": "It is easy to know what will happen in the market, but difficult to know when", "author": "Rohit Chauhan", "date_created": "2005-10-28T00:36:00.000+05:30", "comment_count": 1, "post_url": "http://valueinvestorindia.blogspot.com/", "post_content": "&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">The above comment is from warren buffet. He has also written in the annual letters that he prices the market, rather than time the market. The difference is substantial between the two approaches. The first one, is based on valuation and understanding when the market price is way above the intrinsic value and then going ahead and selling the overvalued security. &lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">The second approach of timing the market is based on psychology of the market and is very difficult (at least for me) to do consistently. People try technical analysis, charts etc to time the market and there could some investors out there who could be good at it. But I have never tried it, as it is too difficult and not really productive for me.&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">The approach in \u2018pricing\u2019 the market works in areas beyond the stock market too. Let me give a personal example&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Interest rates in India have fallen for quite some time. From a 10% in 2001 to around 6-7 % by 2004. This was the time to be an investor in debt as debt funds gave good returns. In 2004 I was looking at a housing loan and had an offer of 7.75 % fixed versus 7.25 % Variable. The loan officer ofcourse was very enthusiastic about the variable loan and kept pushing it. I however was keen on the fixed loan and had worked the following math (with assumptions)&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Long-term inflation \u2013 5-6 % (assumption on the lower end, can be higher)&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">NPA \u2013 0.5-1 %&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Cost of loan servicing for an HFC \u2013 0.25 \u2013 0.5 %&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Return on asset \u2013 1.5 % (for an HFC to earn a reasonable return on equity)&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">The effective cost (rate an HFC should charge me) should be around 7.5 % - 9 %. So with all the optimistic assumptions built into the \u2018value\u2019 of the funds, it should not be priced below 7.5%.&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">As the bank was offering 7.75 % fixed for a tenure of 20 years, I felt the loan was underpriced and opted for a fixed rate loan.&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">I could be wrong in my decision if&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Inflation for next 20 years remains below 5 %&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;br/>&lt;li>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">NPA for most of the HFC are below 0.5 %&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">But the odds are that over a 20-year period, we could have periods of high inflation and high NPA. So I went ahead with the fixed rate loan. At the same time I moved out of debt funds and into floating rate funds.&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">I found the approach of pricing (and working on odds) the market much more productive. I am not right immediately and so there is no instant gratification (all my friends in 2004 kept saying that floating rate is the way to go). But if my logic is correct and I make a rational, informed decision, it has worked out for me.&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Please share any such experiences you would have had &lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;/span>"},

It was fun to hear about the vision that Lloyd and Vicky have for the place and know firmly that we have found our home.  What I really loved was the moment when one of the girls who didn\u2019t make it last week said \u201cso are there other Vineyard churches?\u201d  It was a moment when I realised that as a movement the Vineyard is still not that well known (in NZ at least).  James and I get lots of questions like that from un-churched people, but to hear it from someone who has recently moved to NZ from Oz and is a believer was cool.  She was not the only one with that question on their lips, and it was cool to see the eagerness of the people there to hear the Vineyard story.  It made me remember the hunger I had for the way Vineyard did church / presented the Kingdom when I first joined Bristol.  Over all last night re-kindled that fire in James and I to serve in this church, to bring in the lonely.&lt;br />&lt;br />I am also getting very excited at the fact that next week is the New Zealand Vineyard Women\u2019s Conference.  I am looking forward to catching up with old friends but more than that hearing Eleanor Mumford and Penny Fulton speak and more than that seeing what God might do!  The theme is essence and I have been thinking about this, particularly after buying a new perfume recently.  The time I spent (with James) finding something that said something about me made me think about what essence God would want for me?  I\u2019ve had some thoughts, but I guess the conference will cover this more.&lt;br />&lt;br />Best dash, work is hectic."},

I did not expect to be writing this early. After all, I am new to the game of blog. However, I am now into a bottle of quite cheap wine of the variety Shiraz. It might perhaps account for the paucity of creative thought. The wine might have been cheap as I do not have an infinite budget. So be it. However, no matter the cheapness of the vintage,the effect is surely the same. Have we not heard of the Masters of Wine who tell us all of the flavours they encounter when they soak the wine through their tongues and palates ?  As I am but the offspring of drinkers of ale but who had a father who experienced, per courtesy of his goverment in time of war, the wonderful tastes and flavours of Italy, I cannot expound on what is cheap. Cheap does not of necessity mean poor or bad but only something that the peasants of this world can afford. Taste then, is in the palate and pocketbook of those who can afford to drink expensive wine. Expensive wine is really the produce of the better-known wineries who charge exorbitant prices for their produce. The name is the selling point, not the wine. The wine, from vineyard to vineyard, is no better from place to place. It is the name that dictates the price and that is disgraceful. Any way, this is my first log, and we shall see how it goes whether I shall continue. I keep a hand-written diary that this should not supplant."},

I do not know what the local classic FM radio will have in stall for commemorating this anniversary which is on 26th September 2005. After Bartok's death, 'The New York Times' published an obituary. I will obtain that from the net and reproduce it here in my blog.&lt;br />&lt;br />Also welcome to the Bela Bartok Yahoo Group members who may be reading this blog for the first time. A query was recently raised within the the group about 'What is a Blog'. Well here is my blog dedicated to the memory of Bela Bartok.&lt;br />&lt;br />I have changed my mind about showing photos of Bela Bartok. I now have quite a collection so I will publish them in my blog from now on. I will start with Bartok as a child to his late 20's. After that, some of my photos may be out of sequence as I do not know when some of them were taken.&lt;br />If any one has a photo of Marta Ziegler, Bela Bartok's first wife, could you please let me know through the Yahoo Group. I have not been able to find one on the net.&lt;br />&lt;br />I am also updating photos of myself as the old portrait photo is now 7 years old. It was part of a set taken when I commenced employment with Sydney Hospital back in 1998. I hope you will like my new photos.&lt;br />&lt;br />I will write more when I next become inspired to do so."},

He was stated as saying that Spongebob was gay. This comment was not made, in truth the comment was that there should be concern about a video using hundreds of lovable cartoon characters including Spongebob, Winnie the Pooh, Barney, Big Bird, etc. to promote tolerance of diversity (and sexual orientation among families). The video will be put out by the \"We Are Family Foundation\" to over 61,000 schools in March. This video reportly will be used to encourage children to accept diversity. They claim there is not any homosexuality mention in their materials. Apparently their teacher guides include material such as...&lt;br />&lt;p>1. Suggestions on how to persuade school librarians to highlight books that are \"representative of all sexual orientations.\"&lt;/p>&lt;p>2. Methods to initiate classroom discussion of \"homophobia\" and \"compulsory heterosexuality\" (the culturally-conditioned belief that boys should grow up to be attracted to girls, and girls to boys).&lt;br />&lt;/p>&lt;p>3. Instructions on teaching students to construct a \"Pyramid of Hate,\" a diagram illustrating \"acts of genocide that have been committed against individuals due to (among other things) their sexual orientation.&lt;br />&lt;/p>&lt;p>4. A section on \"appreciating diversity\" that encourages kids to consider what might interest them in \"other sexual orientations.\"&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;p>You can decide what you want to believe about this material that will be sent out to schools. I would suggest for anyone who has children in a public school that receives the material mentioned, that you get involved with the school about it. The beliefs that you want your children to learn are more important than the \"mainstream\" beliefs that are being pushed. &lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;/p>&lt;p>On the We Are Family Foundation Website, they have a tolerance pledge, here it is. &lt;/p>&lt;p>Tolerance is a personal decision that comes from a belief that every person is a treasure. I believe that America's diversity is its strength. I also recognize that ignorance, insensitivity and bigotry can turn that diversity into a source of prejudice and discrimination.&lt;br />To help keep diversity a wellspring of strength and make America a better place for all, I pledge to have respect for people whose abilities, beliefs, culture, race, sexual identity or other characteristics are different from my own. &lt;/p>&lt;p>One last comment, teaching to respect others dispite their diversity, in my opinion, is a good thing, but teaching them that sexual identity \"homosexuality\" is normal (and christians are ignorant, insensitive, and bigots for believing otherwise) is not.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Kristy&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;/p>"},

Buddhism is really different, even though I think the basic foundation of every religion is to give you some guidance as to how to be a good person.  Buddhism fits me really well, because it's really practical, and everything about it is tangible.  How my life turns out is in my control because the decisions I make are based on values I set for myself.  The first thing people tell me is that \"so you think life is all suffering\" which is really not true at all.  The basic idea of Buddhism is that there are many moments in life where things are going well and those moments should be greatly appreciated, but that those moments are not permanent.  Suffering takes place in everyone's life, just in various forms.  What I've learned is that moments in life where things don't run so smoothly, are really moments where you need to take a step back and take it as a learning experience and an opportunity to grow.  These moments end when you realize what the problem is, see how you can make improvements to make your life go back to how it was before, and make those realizations into a reality.  Problems we have in our lives are really obstacles we need to jump over in order to get to where we want to be, and it just makes me more grateful of the positive wonderful experiences of everyday life.  I still have a lot to learn though..."},

Due to the fact that our country was so thirsty for blood after September 11th, we wanted the heads of all the Arab nations.  We did not even consider that our president unilaterally stormed into a independent country and took it over.  This war is nothing more then the expansion of capitalism.  The only people that are benefiting from this war is the corporations who supply the materials and the oil companies that got the contracts for the rebuilding.  I do not mean to insult anyone\u2019s intelligence, but it is so easy to see that and this country needs to wake up and realize that our soldiers are dieing in vain of our leaders.  "},

Here goes two months of events, try to keep up.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"color:#3333ff;\">*Jesus Christ Superstar* Talk about the world's most interesting show experience. It was long rehearsals, more swearing than I've ever heard in a show, at least 7 directors {when there only should have been one}, and more chaos than you can imagine. It actually turned out okay. It was given a terrible review, attacking Chris and Robert {Jesus and Judas}. The true good thing, I came out of it with great friends in Jacqueline and Kelsey. I'm sure you'll hear tons about them.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"color:#33ff33;\">&lt;a href=\"http://http://www.gardenpathways.org/html/arts.htm\">&lt;span style=\"color:#ff6600;\">*E-3*&lt;/span>&lt;/a> &lt;/span>&lt;span style=\"color:#ff6600;\">So supposedly we were shutting down, and we ended up staying open. Shay ended up not going into the army, and I still have no idea why. I was one of two employees that were kept, so I feel special! We're down in numbers, but the kids make it all worthwhile.&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;a href=\"http://http://www.khsd.k12.ca.us/foothill/Default.htm\">&lt;span style=\"color:#000000;\">*Foot&lt;span style=\"color:#ffcc33;\">h&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style=\"color:#ffcc33;\">ill*&lt;/span>&lt;/a> This new year is going awesome. Our choirs are small, young, and inexperienced. I had the best three weeks when Chris Tanja was there, a former band nerd who hangs out all the time before UCLA starts! He's so awesome! And I'm oddly obsessed with Cristian Wolfe, a Romanian student in choir. He's just so darn adorable and the accent is to die for!&lt;br />&lt;br />*Friends* I had the best day with &lt;span style=\"color:#3366ff;\">Sarah Smith&lt;/span> today. We have the dorkiest time together. But I guess that's what you expect from people who've known each other since 5th grade. The happiest news is that &lt;span style=\"color:#cc33cc;\">Jennifer Olson&lt;/span> and her Matt {third times the charm} got engaged! So congrats to them! I've gotten to see &lt;span style=\"color:#33cc00;\">Eric&lt;/span> and Sara quite a bit, and also hung out more with &lt;a href=\"http://anamericaninireland.blogspot.com\">Bryce&lt;/a> and met Lianne {she's like my Asian twin}. They're so sweet.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href=\"http://disney.go.com/disneytheatrical/beautyandthebeast/\">*Beauty and the Beast*&lt;/a> I participated as the Creamer {cast as the Sugar Bowl but the costume didn't permit me to breathe well, and when you sing all the over the staff high notes, it's hard}. It was a fun show, another weird experience. The director had a very interesting style. &lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:times new roman;\">*&lt;span style=\"color:#006600;\">The best part was getting to be in another show with my Jon! Jon Wailin is one of the more special people there are in the world. He is so sweet, talented, and I always have a good time when he's near. He's still my husband, I guess that's what happens when you're married in such a fun show, it carries forever!&lt;/span> &lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:times new roman;\">*&lt;span style=\"color:#000099;\">I &lt;/span>&lt;span style=\"color:#000099;\">had the most fun hanging out with Jen, Helen, Pegeen, and Sarah. We had our little group, people I've been doing theatre with since I was in high school. They are awesome ladies. We are forever &lt;strong>F.A.M.O.U.S&lt;/strong>!&lt;/span> &lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style=\"font-family:times new roman;\">*And Allison Hartsell was in the show, the little sister of someone I was good friends with in jr. high and high school. I can't believe that she's this old, she's so sweet. There were so many great people like Jeff, Jimmy, Garrett, Melinda, Amelia, Aarons, Evan, Lyssa, Shannon {my partner in crime}, and my child Alex. &lt;span style=\"color:#ff99ff;\">One of the most exciting things was to getting to be in a show with &lt;/span>&lt;a href=\"http://www.livejournal.com/users/louer/\">&lt;span style=\"color:#ff99ff;\">Bill Brown&lt;/span>&lt;/a>&lt;span style=\"color:#ff99ff;\">, a friend of mine from high school who just graduated from UCSB. He was the Beast and he rocked it every night!&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;br />*NYC* The most important thing that I have to tell is that I am going to New York City Thanksgiving week with the McFarland choir. Garrett, Kendall {his mom}, &lt;span style=\"color:#006600;\">Jon&lt;/span>, and I are going. I get to march in the Macy's Day Thanksgiving Parade! We're going to see &lt;a href=\"http://avenueq.com\">\"Avenue Q\"&lt;/a> and it's a great week with people I love. &lt;span style=\"color:#006600;\">Jon&lt;/span> and I have decided we'll keep each other sane and have the best time! There's no one I'd rather go with them than him! We leave November 21st and I could not be more excited!&lt;br />&lt;br />That's all, I'll try to keep more in on my entries!&lt;br />&lt;strong>\"Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme. Beauty and the Beast. Ah...Ah...AAHHH!!!!!&lt;/strong> &lt;/span>"},

Wander through the streets of Jakarta, and it\u2019s not uncommon to hear people shouting in conversation despite being within a metre or two of one another. Many older vehicles have long discarded their mufflers, and trundle along the street inducing headaches in anyone unfortunate enough to be within earshot. Head to a cinema, and the soundtrack is pumped out at a significantly louder volume than theatres in other parts of the world.&lt;br />&lt;br />Or consider the street food that constitutes the diet of many Indonesians. A popular snack stand is simply labelled gorengan, which translates as fried. On offer are half-a-dozen different things \u2013 tofu, tempeh, banana, cassava and more \u2013 battered and deep-fried in cheap oil to the point where the ingredient at the core of the greasy delight is sometimes hard to locate. An essential condiment to gorengan is whole green chillies, which are liberally added. Salt, chilli and oil are the mainstays of Indonesian popular cuisine, and people embrace it.&lt;br />&lt;br />Or look at the forms of entertainment that keep people enraptured. The Indonesian film industry exists largely of horror films. Most are needlessly and gorily bloody, with extended scenes of torture a common feature. Where horror films elsewhere rely on developing characters in whom the audience invest their sympathies and use the power of inferred terror to reach the dark side of viewers, such techniques are eschewed by Indonesian film makers.  Instead, the characters are thinly drawn and the violence is bloody, graphic, and always front and centre.&lt;br />&lt;br />On one level, you can treat these things as discrete, separate idiosyncrasies. But I think there\u2019s a lot more to it than that.&lt;br />&lt;br />On a social and cultural level, the Indonesia of today is not too different to the Indonesia of recent decades, the very place and time when today\u2019s Indonesians were growing up. So people here grew up with thumping noise, palate-burning cuisine and graphic violence, and have over time developed a resistance to it. Adding to the phenomena is the frequent thuggery of Indonesia\u2019s not-so-distant past. The norm for most people, therefore, is a high level of sensory input, so that on a sociological and even physical level, they become unfazed by it. This, for many people, is life as it always has been.&lt;br />&lt;br />For any new sensation to make an impact, therefore, it must reach a level of intensity greater than that with which people are already familiar. Or looked at another way, people become far more tolerant of unpleasant environmental factors, so that the urge to object (say, to quagmire traffic jams that steal hours of your time each day) is less.&lt;br />&lt;br />When I ride the Kopaja minibus, one thing often surprises me. The standard process for paying your Rp 2,000 fare is to wait for the bus jockey to wander up the aisle, his (and occasionally her) presence  heralded by him shaking a handful of coins to create a tell-tale tinkle. It\u2019s a distinctive sound, though a relatively soft one, and I always hear them coming behind me. But I\u2019ve noticed that many Indonesian passengers seem oblivious to it, even as the sound is being made right behind them, and rely on being physically tapped on the shoulder before apparently noticing the presence of the jockey.&lt;br />&lt;br />The prospect that the passenger is deliberately playing dumb (or in this case, deaf) to avoid paying their fare appears unlikely: everyone pretty swiftly is asked to pay up, and fare-evasion is virtually zero. More likely is that people have weaker hearing, either in a physical sense or in the social sense, that they are less attentive to the sounds around them and so block them out. Both are possible, and reflect the consequence of growing up in a noisy environment \u2013 it dulls your hearing.&lt;br />&lt;br />Replicate that across all five senses, and you can appreciate that Jakarta can have a remarkable effect on those who grow up in it.&lt;br />&lt;br />But I suspect the phenomenon reaches the sensory organs, and also affects people\u2019s psyche.&lt;br />&lt;br />Scandal after scandal has rocked the Indonesian political establishment, with each allegation of corruption and impropriety more tawdry than the one that came before it: lawmakers failing to attend sessions of parliament, bureaucrats signing off on resources contracts that undervalue national assets by billions of dollars, legislators brazenly accepting kickbacks to support the funding of certain projects at the expense of others, dozens dying as a bridge collapses after inferior materials were likely used in its construction.&lt;br />&lt;br />The sense of outrage, however, is muted. Little of this is new, and decades of disappointment have meant that the standards the public expects their leaders to uphold are so low as to be negligible. Only the very rare scandal that can cut through the public\u2019s collective thick hide \u2013 like the Muhammad Nazaruddin saga, in which a government legislator allegedly sought kickbacks for a construction project before running off to Colombia when he was found out \u2013 manages the inspire genuine anger.&lt;br />&lt;br />Of course, there is an upside to this sensory and psychic overload for people who have grown up among it. It breeds a hardy resilience, meaning that no matter how long the odds of success might be, people persist and persist, and upon each setback, dust themselves off and try again. People are also forced to be more creative and entrepreneurial, finding something new and inventive to rise above the ordinary \u2013 thankfully, not everyone simply becomes louder, spicier or more visceral.&lt;br />&lt;br />People are ultimately a product of their environment, and that has never been more evident than in the bustling metropolis of Jakarta. My entire thesis, I admit, is based on anecdotal evidence, but the unrelenting sights, sounds and smells of the city \u2013 let alone those things than affect the mind as well as the sense organs \u2013 surely have some underlying explanation. From my vantage point, this is it."},

I vaguely remember this from last year, but this year I'm awake enough to realize that the paper has name after name of graduating students and, I finally figured out, the name of the university they will be attending.  In other words, they managed to pass the dreaded entrance exam!!!&lt;br />&lt;br />With the specialized English course at our school, a large number of the 3-5 class (the English course students) are planning to study English at university.  Many of them will stay in Yamanashi, but quite a few are planning to head into Tokyo, or tried for private universities which are much more difficult to get into.  Several of these universities have a listening test along with reading and writing (for English), so since November, I have been meeting a student named Shiho at least once a week, sometimes twice a week, to practice listening.&lt;br />&lt;br />Last year, I had a similar student, but since it was my first year, I had not had her as a student in my class and didn't know her very well.  This year, with Shiho, I REALLY wanted to her to pass that exam.  Her spoken English is pretty good but she had zero confidence in her ability to understand LONG (7-10 minute) passages of English and to answer sometimes complicated questions.&lt;br />&lt;br />At most schools, the graduating seniors start coming to school for only half a day during the month of December and then only one day from January to graduation day (March 1 for us), and at that point only for meetings, not for class.  They are meant to be focusing completely on their future during this time.  If they have already passed exams or aren't planning on going to university, no problem.  It's a skate.  But so many of them were completely stressed out in January and the first few weeks of February.  Shiho and I met in the long, class-free afternoons and for eternal stretches, I would read the various practice passages (sometimes as boring as listening to paint dry!) and she would answer the questions.  Then we'd check the answers and I would try to explain if she got something wrong.  &lt;br />&lt;br />Anyway, make a long story short, I saw Shiho in the hallway this morning on my way back to the teacher room.  She and another one of my favorites from the 3-5 class were checking out the wall of names in the hallway.  She spots me halfway down the hall and starts yelling, \"Amy-sensei, I passed the exam!!!!\"  She grabs me in the tightest hug I think I've ever experienced.  Typically, Japanese people don't hug -- at least they don't hug me -- it was the most emotion I have ever seen from a Japanese person.  She kept saying, \"thank you, thank you, thank you, Amy.\"  I knew she was worried and stressed, but her relief was even more than I imagined.&lt;br />&lt;br />Anyway, of course I was cheering loudly (you know us loud Americans!) so we created quite a spectacle for a few minutes.

It's been so long since I've done one of these I'm trying to remember how to do it.  Introduction perhaps... To this blog: it was set up by me for my girlfriend and I to post back and forth on.  Thoughts, experiences, whatever...the typical blog.  It's unknown at this time, so Charlie is probably the only one who will be reading these introductory posts.  I've had a blog for over 2 years now, but my parents read it... and I'm not out to them yet.  So since I've realized my sexuality and come out to my friends, I've still had to keep it a secret on my journal.  This is a chance for me to break away from that, for me to be truly open about my self-realization, my past, and the wonderful woman in my life.&lt;BR>&lt;BR>The title:  four thirty pm... for the majority of people across the globe, it means work is letting out and you get to go home for the day, right?  Well my day just begins at four thirty, because that's when my girly wakes up and I call her.  Introduction to me: 22 american, female, lesbian, college student.

[i didnt realise till after i took the pic.]&lt;br />&lt;br />omg. &lt;b>chris&lt;/b>, the new guy is so much cuter in real life. i know he sorta looks weird on their website, but in real life, he's like delish.&lt;br />&lt;br />anyway, the boys rocked. i managed to get pics of sam performing, and one good pic of matt while playing the drums and another of chris. i couldnt get mas from my side of the stage.&lt;br />&lt;br />i have never screamed so much in my life. i was like half deaf when their performance was over.&lt;br />&lt;br />ooh, matt's friends were there and they had their own little mosh pit and they uhh.....danced during one of the songs.&lt;br />&lt;br />anyway, i think this is the hilight of well, my night. after they finished their set, i just shouted at matt, asking him to marry me. and i was right in front too, so yeah, he saw me.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;span style=\"color:#9999ff;\">he blushed, smiled and did this giggle thing.&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;br />he smiled, at me! even thinking about it is freaking me out now.&lt;br />&lt;br />his friend[a guy] then screamed, \"Matt, i wanna have your babies!\"&lt;br />&lt;br />and some guy backstage yelled out \"Have fun!\"&lt;br />&lt;br />what a rush....&lt;br />&lt;br />then levi and i scooted to the side of the stage to pass stuff to the pugs. and well, sam was there signing autographs. so levi and i started talking to him about wanting to take a pic with him and well, he agreed. then the lights went off cuz the last band started playing.&lt;br />&lt;br />i told him it was dark and omg, he started getting dramatically upset. that was like so cute!&lt;br />&lt;br />oh well, then we talked to chris for a few minutes. he's really nice and like i said, so much cuter in person.&lt;br />&lt;br />ooh, now matt, i got to touch his shoulder. [ i know i sound obsessive but yeah.]&lt;br />i passed my envelope to him and well, i guess he thought it was for him to sign and when i told him that it was for him, he couldnt hear me cuz the music was too loud, i had to tiptoe and whisper[more like shout] it to him. and to steady myself, i grabbed his shoulder.&lt;br />&lt;br />he grinned and said thank you so sweetly when i gave him the stuff that i just melted there.&lt;br />&lt;br />and he smells so good even when he's sweaty. lolz.&lt;br />i'm in love, and i've gotta go.&lt;br />&lt;br />you wont be seeing me on in a long while cuz my pc's down.&lt;br />but i'll try though.&lt;br />will be back with pics from the gig.&lt;br />&lt;br />cya loves,&lt;br />faith."},

The argument used in making the tax cuts was that \"it's our money, so we should have it returned to us.\"  The rationale for having larger tax cuts go to wealthier Americans was that \"they pay more taxes, so they should get more back.\"  It's certainly true that the money given back through tax cuts was \"our money.\"  That's where taxes come from.  My pocket.  Yours.  It's certainly true that some people pay more taxes than others.  I work for a non-profit; my salary is low (really!); I pay less income taxes than a whole lot of people. &lt;br />&lt;br />But the problems caused by those tax cuts have been quite serious.  Not only do we have a ballooning national debt, we have a declining dollar, severe restrictions on spending for domestic programs, and no way out that I can see for a health care system in crisis.&lt;br />&lt;br />Now we come to the discussion of Social Security.  It gives me a total headache.  Without the knowledge or the desire to involve myself in all of the math involved, I still think it's a boondoggle.  Just another way to take a swipe at poor folks and line the pockets of the rich.  The arguments in favor of privatizing Social Security is that it is in crisis, that we are fast approaching the day when less money will flow into the system than will be paid out, that private accounts will give the individual more control over their future benefits as well as giving them something to leave as a legacy for their descendants. &lt;br />&lt;br />But there is apparently no crisis.  In 2018, we'll reach the point that was planned for and understood in 1983--current income for the program will be less than current outlays, SO the program will have to dip into its savings account:  The Social Security Trust Fund.  That's the money that we--you and I--have been paying into the program all these years, more money than was actually needed to keep the program going, just SO that there would be a surplus in 2018 and we'd have enough money to keep paying benefits at their promised level. &lt;br />&lt;br />That surplus exists now as part of the national debt.  The government has borrowed that money to pay for other things, like war or tax cuts or even health care.  But the government has always--until now--promised to pay it back.  Even now the Constitution still requires that it be paid back. &lt;br />&lt;br />But the President is out and about the country now saying that there is no trust fund, that 2018 is the year in which SS goes bankrupt.   It would appear that the only reason that this could happen is if the government defaults on its promise to pay back what it borrowed.&lt;br />&lt;br />So now the light finally comes on in my feeble brain:  The money that was used to give tax cuts, more to the rich because \"they paid more taxes,\" is going to be paid for with money that was paid into the system (to save for the rainy day in 2018) by poor folks, middle class folks. &lt;br />&lt;br />How can I say that?  You only pay SS taxes on the first $90,000 of earned income.   If you earn more than that, you don't pay FICA.  If you have unearned income (investments, capital gains) you don't pay FICA on that.  It's just us working folks that paid all that money into the Trust Fund.&lt;br />&lt;br />So we pay, they get the tax cut, and we lose Social Security.  If that ain't Hood Robin, then maybe it's just plain Robbing Hood.&lt;br />&lt;br />I'd say that that sucks canal water, but it's way worse than that."},

Initially, a Libra partner may catch your attention with their elegant charm and attentiveness during courtship. But as you get to know them better, you're likely to be even more drawn to your Libra's appreciation for beauty and fairness, as well as their peaceful disposition. People born under this sign are known for being romantic partners who have an excellent ability to build and grow an egalitarian relationship. Librans may seem to be a bit lazy to you at times. However, their love of pleasure can be a benefit, too \u2014 one that can roust both of you from falling into boring relationship routines. In the bedroom, you'll likely find the Scales to be both creative and driven, with a significant sexual appetite. In general, Libras are flirtatious, talkative people who are almost always open to amusing distractions.&lt;br />______________________________________________________________&lt;br />What's Your Sense of Humor?&lt;br />Shaun, your sense of humor is Banter &lt;br />&lt;br />Like a king of pinball, you've made an art of playing off of people because your sense of humor is all about banter. Like many great comedians before you, a roundtable of friends, or a roomful of targets, is the catalyst for what makes you laugh. It brings out the wit \u2014 and sometimes the nitwit \u2014 in everyone. &lt;br />&lt;br />It's quantity, not quality that matters as you and your friends alternate outbursts like the riffs of a hit single. Here's the bottom line: You're a social creature. Other people's inside jokes even strike you as funny. You manage to gravitate toward people who can appreciate a tall tale and you've probably never hesitated to fire off a zinger \u2014 even in a roomful of strangers. So keep it up with your bantering methods. Laughter, after all, keeps the world going 'round. &lt;br />______________________________________________________________&lt;br />Which \"American Idol\" Are You?&lt;br />Shaun, you're a Trained Professional &lt;br />&lt;br />The stage. The big screen. The boardroom. Wherever your sights are set, you're ready for the spotlight. Confident and talented, you wouldn't think of going for the big time without doing the proper prep work first. And it shows in your polished performance and dedicated attitude \u2014 all of which makes competitors respect you and fans want to be you.&lt;br />&lt;br />You're an enthusiastic competitor who doesn't mind putting in the extra hours to sharpen your skills. You probably learned that there's no substitute for hard work whether you're trying out for a team, a band, a job, or American Idol. So keep on practicing. It's sure to take you to the top in no time! &lt;br />______________________________________________________________&lt;br />What's Your Superpower?&lt;br />&lt;br />Holy smokes, you've got X-RAYVISION! Your answers show a keen sense of insight, coupled with a piercing mind. Okay, so you may not be able to see through brick walls \u2014 not yet, anyway. But you probably enjoy looking beneath the surface of things and reading between the lines. Your X-ray vision lets you see things others can't, making you good at reading people's motivations, solving mysteries of all kinds, or maybe just finding misplaced car keys. You've got the gift, so if you haven't started using it, it's high time you did. Just think of the benefits: You could really start undressing people with your eyes. Winning lottery tickets and grand prize soda-bottle caps will be effortlessly revealed to you. So start practicing! All superheroes know that developing your powers begins with mental training. To start honing your X-ray vision, try looking for the hidden meaning in things. Read old English poetry. Do crossword puzzles. Think metaphorically. Once you've trained your mind, you'll be ready to instruct the eyes. Start with gauzey fabrics, then move on to semi-transparent glass. Keep at it, and you'll be seeing through concrete slabs in no time. Good luck!&lt;br />______________________________________________________________&lt;br />Shaun, based on your responses, your top career area is Math and Science &lt;br />&lt;br />Careers in this field often demand that you enjoy thinking analytically, have strong reasoning skills and the ability to approach a problem from a variety of angles. You're not content to just question \u2014 you're motivated to test your ideas to see if they are right. Even if it's not a common perception, people who enjoy the Math and Sciences are highly imaginative and intuitive. &lt;br />______________________________________________________________&lt;br />Shaun, you are Balanced-brained &lt;br />&lt;br />That means you are able to draw on the strengths of both the right and left hemispheres of your brain, depending upon a given situation. &lt;br />&lt;br />When you need to explain a complicated process to someone, or plan a detailed vacation, the left hemisphere of your brain, which is responsible for your ability to solve problems logically, might kick in. But if you were critiquing an art opening or coming up with an original way to file papers, the right side of your brain, which is responsible for noticing subtle details in things, might take over. &lt;br />&lt;br />While many people have clearly dominant left- or right-brained tendencies, you are able to draw on skills from both hemispheres of your brain. This rare combination makes you a very creative and flexible thinker. &lt;br />&lt;br />The down side to being balanced-brained is that you may sometimes feel paralyzed by indecision when the two hemispheres of your brain are competing to solve a problem in their own unique ways.&lt;br />______________________________________________________________&lt;br />The Classic IQ Test&lt;br />What's Your IQ?&lt;br />Congratulations, Shaun!&lt;br />Your IQ score is 133 &lt;br />&lt;br />This number is based on a scientific formula that compares how many questions you answered correctly on the Classic IQ Test relative to others. &lt;br />&lt;br />Your Intellectual Type is Facts Curator. This means you are highly intelligent and have picked up an impressive and unique collection of facts and figures over the years. You've got a remarkable vocabulary and exceptional math skills \u2014 which puts you in the same class as brainiacs like Bill Gates. And that's just some of what we know about you from your test results."},

The lead in news headline was the good news that traffic will still be able to get around the detour caused by this girder weighing several tons laying across the road.

While I'm not an i-Pod owner/user (I'm tragically unhip, sorry to say. I always seem to be 3 years behind the curve on stuff like this) and I don't use i-Tunes, this little number intrigues me. Not from a consumer standpoint. I doubt I'd use it much. See when I watch a TV show or a movie I tend to get very immersed in it. If it's a particularly good show or movie I easily get sucked in and get lost in time- I'll emotionally buy in for all it's worth. Which is fine if you're in your home by yourself. Not so good if you're watching the mini-tele while waiting for the elevator to open.&lt;br />&lt;br />No, my interest in the v-Pod is the new video content distribution system Apple has started. Their deal with ABC/Disney to sell popular shows and such for $1.99 a pop is the video version of i-Tunes. Suddenly the barrier between filmmaker and buying public is much thinner. In response to a content creator driven trend Apple hooked their i-Tunes to handle podcasts natively. Is it a stretch to think that given sufficient creator movement in the independent video vidcasting that their video side of i-Tunes wouldn't hook into vidcasts eventually? Combine a vidcast enabled i-Tunes in conjunction with clever animator type dudes who put out the content and let the world know via a blog and RSS... welcome to self syndication. Podcasts have turned the stoic broadcasting world on its ear. Not that the content available on podcasts is overwhelmingly superior to commercial radio. Like all content that has a low cost of entry (ie: alot of rank amateurs are making a lot of stuff) most of it is trash. (except for &lt;a href=\"http://animationpodcast.com/\">The Animation Podcast&lt;/a>. That rocks!) No, what kicked commercial radio in the groin in podcating was the freedom of choice for the consumer. Suddenly the power has shifted and commercial radio is still scrambling to catch up. It's the &lt;a href=\"http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/\">world of the longtail&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />Will the v-Pod and vidcasts (anim-casts?) do the same for TV? Sure, making small Quicktimes and putting them on the web is not a new idea. Shoot, I released my first short film on my website over 8 years ago. But there's something about having a consumer product designed specifically for this content that lends a certain amount of critical mass to the movement. MP3's were not invented by Apple. Apple just made a clever gadget that made MP3's stylish, easy and popular. The hope here is that the same can happen for online video.&lt;br />&lt;br />Have any of you started crafting your master plan to be a self supporting animator who sells their episodes to a faithful fanbase via i-Tunes? You know somebody is gonna be able to do it. Why not you? Heck.. why not me?!"},

The last four weeks have been a  combination of flying to Ahemdabad to visit relatives and pick up wedding stuff,  work, being told to drop my Canadian accent and speak like a local, more work,  freaking out about carrying wedding stuff through customs, flying back to  Canada, getting married, going to Banff and Jasper for our honeymoon, and then  flying back to Pune.  &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>  &lt;div>&lt;span class=\"873403217-13082004\">&lt;/span> &lt;/div>  &lt;div>&lt;span class=\"873403217-13082004\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Over the past couple  of weeks I have made a couple of attempts to write, each time to be twarted by  work, crying babies, mental block, or sheer fatigue.  So, the following is a  combination of writings from the past couple of weeks, as well as an update on  the wedding.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>  &lt;div>&lt;span class=\"873403217-13082004\">&lt;/span> &lt;/div>  &lt;div>&lt;span class=\"873403217-13082004\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;strong>Flying back  to Canada&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>  &lt;div>&lt;span class=\"873403217-13082004\">&lt;span class=\"016260203-24072004\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">There is a temporary peace in the air.  The baby right behind  me with the lungs of a tenor is asleep, to my left, one baby is being fed, the  other is in and out of sleep.  The peace, however, cannot be fully enjoyed. Feel  it is like the eye of a storm, a calm that is enjoyed temporarily, however, at  any second you know that the peace will be replaced with the barrage of rain and  wind.  In this case, it is a barrage of baby rattles and stereo-sound crying.  I  am currently on hour 22 and 8 minutes of the trip back home.  Only 8 hours and  13 minutes more according to the trip status monitors on the plane.  What keeps  the mind sane admist the assault on the ears is this hindi film, something about  wanting to be Madhuri Dixit (a famous Indian actress) and the conversation of  the guy next to me on the plane.  I speak too soon...to my far left, it has  began.  I ignored the initial whimpers hoping they were abberations in the  peace, the storm will soon arrive gathering steam from the west it will rapidly  awaken the rest of the natural elements surrounding me 'til we are drowned in  the wail of infancy.  &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class=\"016260203-24072004\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">The movie, &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class=\"016260203-24072004\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon, definitely worth a  watch. &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>  &lt;div> &lt;div>&lt;span class=\"016260203-24072004\">&lt;/span> &lt;/div> &lt;div>&lt;span class=\"016260203-24072004\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">For my loyal three  readers, you may be wondering where I have been the past couple of weeks.  Why  haven't you been writing Pablo, you ask?  Where have you been?  Wish I had  something exciting or interesting to respond with.  Instead all I can offer is  that I have been doing pretty much nothing but work since the last time we met.   Working in a new office from the ground-level is definitely a liberating  feeling.  It is as if all the shackles have been removed and creativity and  intiative become the driving force behind the growth and not policy and  procedure.  Really enjoying the challenge of working in a small team again and  helping grow the organization.  We have faced a lot of interesting challenges  along the way, the latest being with regards to understanding the Indian  employee psyche.  Bought a couple of books on Organization Behaviour for Indian  firms.  Utterly dreadful reads, however, hopefully they will have some  informational of value.  For example, after reading chapter 3, have come to  understand that employment stability is a bedrock in the Indian mind-set, that  letting somebody go is something that is not done.  Interestingly though, when I  look at the labour market here and the movement of employees, seems that loyalty  is a one-way transaction.  Believe that we are quite fortunate with the team  that we have here, good bunch of guys and gals.  Heck, the guys even put  together a little Congrats on Getting Married thing, with the requisite smearing  of cake on the face and through the hair.  Not sure if it is sugar or the flour,  but cakes makes for some fine hair styling product.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div> &lt;div>&lt;span class=\"016260203-24072004\">&lt;/span> &lt;/div> &lt;div>&lt;span class=\"016260203-24072004\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">Argh...this movie is  getting pretty sad.  Poor Chukti, not sure her dreams of becoming Madhuri Dixit  are going to come true anymore.  Hold up...maybe they will after the  makeover...never know, maybe she'll become Fair and Lovely.  For those that  aren't too familiar with Indian cosmetic products, Fair &amp; Lovely is a facial  cream that apparently lightens your skin and subsequently makes you lovely.  The  majority of the commercials revolve around a girl's life changing after using  the product. &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div> &lt;div>&lt;span class=\"016260203-24072004\">&lt;/span> &lt;/div> &lt;div>&lt;span class=\"016260203-24072004\">&lt;span class=\"873403217-13082004\">&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;strong>It's the time to  party...&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div> &lt;div>&lt;span class=\"016260203-24072004\">&lt;span class=\"873403217-13082004\"> &lt;div>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;span class=\"788301709-04072004\">There's a popular  hindi song out here with a bunch of words in hindi (can' figure out the  transalation yet, however, the chorus is 'it's the time to party...'  That  pretty much summarised this weekend.  From Friday evening at 7 'til right now as  I'm writing this on the Pume-Mumbai highway, the weekend has been a blast.  We  start the weekend off on Friday evening with Theo and I hitting the  barbershop...a shave, a haircut, a facial, and a head massage later ...also 200  rupees later, we're ready to hit the town.  to be fair....the haircut and stuff  was more 'cause i was sporting a bush than for the upcoming weekend  activities.   oh yeah....for those that know me....a bit of a warning...think  i'be gotten a bit soft lately...as witnessed by the fcial/face message!!!  more  to come about that softnes...&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div> &lt;div>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;span class=\"788301709-04072004\">&lt;/span>&lt;/span> &lt;/div> &lt;div>&lt;span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;\">&lt;span class=\"788301709-04072004\">this weekkend was  theo's b-day and we were asked by his bride to show him a good time this  weekend...think we succeded.

I hope you all have a wonderful day with the person who has captured your heart.  And if you're single, indulge in a little self-love (and no I don't mean masturbation, although you may do that generously if you wish) :P&lt;br />&lt;br />I had a great Valentine's weekend.  Friday nite, Chris came over, and I made a pizza and gave him my two V-day presents: a key to my apartment and some sexy lingerie (for me, not him)  ;)  Then, he gave me his presents: an anthology of great poems (over 600 of them!) and a new diary (since I had been asking for one).  I really enjoyed the poem anthology.  Anyone who knows me well knows I am a poetry nut - and he's one of a handful of people who know me well.  Chris actually tried to trick me and find out some of my favorite poems and poets by asking for my advice on which poems to use on a \"very important, 8-unit classroom project\" he had to design for college freshmen on poetry.  I was totally tricked; I came up with this whole plan and submitted it to him.  :P  But since I never told him any of MY personal favorites and instead told him which I thought would be good for college freshmen, he didn't get the answers he was looking for.  I guess it backfired on him   hehehe  But it was really thoughtful  :)&lt;br />&lt;br />Saturday, I planned this extravagant candle-lit dinner at home with me cooking steak for the first time in my life, coupled with garlic bread, broccoli, mashed potatoes, and a cherry cheesecake.  I went to a butcher and bought a nice ribeye steak.  Then I got all the rest of the food ready.  As a finishing touch, I put on makeup, did my hair, and wore an evening gown that I've never worn before.  That was the upside.  The downside of the evening was that I ruined everything except for the steak and garlic bread  :P  Oh well...  I'll do better next time  :P  It was still nice, even if everything wasn't \"perfect\".  ;)&lt;br />&lt;br />On Sunday, we went to San Diego to drop off Toasty  :(  We had a nice ride up and went to lunch at El Torito with my sister and her b/f.  Then, we went and saw \"Hitch\" at the movie theatres, which was cute.  Not wonderful, not great - cute.  After that, we went for some Korean BBQ (mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!) and then drove home.&lt;br />&lt;br />I was so tired this morning (we both got home late) that I slept through my first class today  :(  Oh well, it was definitely worth it  :)  Happy Valentine's Day everyone!  :D"},

They landed in Basra in 1914, took Baghdad in 1917 and reached Mosul in the north in 1919. During that campaign, the Iraqi people were also divided. Some wanted to get rid of the Ottoman occupation at any cost; some saw the British as \"infidels\" and preferred the Muslim Turks.&lt;br />&lt;br />The first thing they did when they took Baghdad was to declare that they came as \"liberators\" not conquerors. They put the country under direct rule but used a collection of people to form a government (Governing Council \u2013 Interim Government)!!&lt;br />&lt;br />In June 1920, the whole country was up in arms; towns and countryside; south; center and north \u2013 all corners of all the triangles. Casualties and expenses mounted to convince the British that they should let the people govern themselves.&lt;br />&lt;br />They too decided to make the country \"in their own image\" \u2013 A constitutional monarchy. A national assembly convened in 1924. Large segments (following the advice of leading clerics) boycotted it. It resulted in what looked like a democracy (parties, elections, opposition), but it was basically dominated by cronies: a cronycracy.&lt;br />&lt;br />The system had a large number of good aspects. It made the country stand on its feet. Many good institutions were established; there was some accountability; management of resources was acceptable. But people were not convinced of its legitimacy. It took many political stands with its friends the British (but against some national sentiments and so-called \"national constants\"). The British embassy in Baghdad meddled too much in local politics. They had their reasons of course: oil, WW2, the undeclared Anglo-American conflict for influence in the area and, finally, the cold war. For a long time, many of the national politicians (some of whom were good people) were looked at as traitors or collaborators\u2026 and were detested.&lt;br />&lt;br />Ultimately, 37 years later, it was toppled in 1958 by a coup of military officers using a small military force. The people did not defend it. For the next 10 years, Iraq spiraled down a path of military coups that ultimately led to the previous regime.&lt;br />&lt;br />In this short account, I have deliberately overlooked many other important (local) economic and (regional and international) political factors that had significant effect; but my aim is to remain focused on the issue being discussed.&lt;br />&lt;br />I can see so many similarities with the present situation. Why can't people learn from past lessons? If everything goes well and according to plan, under the present course, then the US administration could still end up making the same mistake as good old Britain."},

I guess I'm in 'sleeping' mode! Bad... that's very bad! It's not only making me tired and sleepy, it's also a waste of time! I haven't done a lot of things that I suppose to do... like the handstitches... workshop! Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! Seeeeeeeee! It's only 12 and I'm so sleepy! Sigh...&lt;br />&lt;br />Anyway, I watched Harry Potter today with my sis and bro. Watched it at the Shaw tower.... Haha! It's rather empty... ^^ I like it that way, although the seats are quite small. I'm fine with that, but it's actually the movie I want to complain! It's such a disappointment... I felt the movie is too short... okay, it's long, but I think it focus the wrong part. For this third movie, Harry seems to have very little exciting part, compared to the previous two. And the story seems to be quite different from the book.... there are a few interesting part though.. like Black and Lupin catching Peter (the rat) and suddenly Snape appeared, jumping into conclusion ('as usual' accordin to Black). Harry in this third movie has changed... more bad-tempered.. just like the book. Ron is cute cause he's still afraid of spider. Hhehee ^^! But the story is vey confusing, especially, the time-reverse thingy.... it seems they are not really changing anything.... (Although they did 'save' two lives...) And the match... is very blur and short... -_- Anyway, I really think reading the book is a beeter choice... the story will be clearer and I think my imaginations can run even further and wider. This time, the movie isn't good.... or perhaps, my imgination is too wide...&lt;br />&lt;br />Speaking of imagiunation and fantasy................. I'm into Yami no Matsuei these days! Just bought the comics recently... ^^ Now, I owned only 2,3 and 5... Oh my gosh! they are soooo handsome! Soooo charming! Especially Tsuzuki and the doctor.... although the doctor (Muraki) is mad.... but he's sooo charming! The comics is so funny... Muraki always sexually harasses Tsuzuki... and there are other characters... who are very charming too! Tsuzuki's young panther, Hisoka and his ex-panther Tatsumi... wow! I'm falling in love with the comics! ^^&lt;br />&lt;br />Sigh... but right now, I got to stop my slacking mode and sleeping mode..... time to move on to my.......... working mode... sigh....&lt;br />&lt;/span>"},

Of which, in turn, over 60% is &lt;a href=\"http://www.hansagroup.com/eng/\">Hansabank&lt;/a>. Hansabank has done extremely well over the past 4 years and &lt;a href=\"http://www.hansagroup.com/eng/investor_newsboard_ir_23204_2005_02.html\">made record profits this year again&lt;/a>, being the main motor of keeping my overall investments in green, but now it seems the fun is all over.&lt;br />&lt;br />The story of the day is that Swedish Swedbank, the main shareholder of Hansabank, has made an offer to buy out the remaining shares of minority shareholders at \u20ac11.00. Of course it is good news in the sense that it does offer a premium over current shareprice of about 8%, but since the market jumped already to \u20ac11.60, it might not be enough. I seriously hope that Swedbank will not be able to pull it off this time around because I believe in Hansabank in the long term and it will not be easy to find another investment object which offers similar risk-return ratios (as the stock has soared almost at a rate of +50% yoy). If this is to be happen, I as an investor, expect much higer premium than this.&lt;br />&lt;br />I will keep you posted on what the developments will be."},

The 16th of April was Tulika and Samarth Sinha's 3rd wedding anniversary. Samarth, ever the adventurous soul, decided to surprise Tuli and arranged for a weekend at a relatively obscure jungle resort called Wild Valley. He asked me if I and my other friends are willing to join. I readily agreed once I saw that bank balance approved it. Others (Rat, Summya, etc.) had some pressing work on the weekend, so they were not able to join. The fun part was : Tuli was not supposed to know about this till the date of the journey! Kunal (aka Tikloo), Samarth's nephew and Siddarth Singh, Samarth's classmate during his BIT days, joined. With Siddarth were his wife Mahima and their 11 month old baby - Anirudh.&lt;br />Kunal and I joined Samarth and Tuli at their place on the 15th night, had some beer and dinner. Tuli demonstrated a few steps she had choreographed for her office cul-fest and was just getting in the mood for a night-out when we Samarth faked a headache and went to sleep. Tuli was probably a little suspicious at my unannounced arrival and my decision to stay back (something I hadn't done for a while). But on the whole she was unaware of what lay ahead.&lt;br />So before D-Day dawned (at 4 AM on the 16th of April), she was rudely woken up by Samarth and was told that we are to head for that jungle trip! Oh Boy! I wanted to see her face while she digested the surprise! Unfortunately, my lazy ass refused to get off the warm bed...&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;strong>&lt;u>The Journey&lt;/u>&lt;/strong>&lt;br />We started early and by 6:30 AM - we had already hit Kanakpura Road on the Sinha Family's Esteem. Samarth took the steering with Kunal as the navigator while I, Tuli and Chaiti (Tuli and Sam's one and an half year old daughter) sprawled over the back seat. Siddharth and Mahima joined us further ahead on Kanakpura Road. We stopped in between and quick introductions were made. Kanakpura - Malvalli - Kollegal passed by quickly but after that the journey was a bit treacherous with a few landmarks and road signs to guide us. However, Samarth had sourced the microinstructions from Andrew, the guy handles the bookings etc from Bangalore - that saved the day. On the way, we crossed the Odeyarpalya village which is a Tibetian settlement (very much like Bylakuppe in Coorg). It seems like an interesting place to see. Finally just at the Tamil Nadu check post, we took a left and asked for \"Daniel's Farm\" and everyone seemed to know where it is! It took us about 4.5 hours to complete the 190 km journey. The journey was by and large uneventful.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;strong>&lt;u>Wild Valley Farm&lt;/u>&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&lt;a href=\"http://www.wildvalleyfarm.com/\">Wild Valley&lt;/a> is situated in Germalam, on Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border, 4000 ft above the mean sea level. It is some 190 kms from Bangalore, out of which the last few kilometers are barely motorable - bikers, be warned. It is an actual 100 acre farm overlooking the Western Ghats, not a landscaped holiday resort with airconditioning and room service. This place is supposed to be one of Veerappan's hang-out while he was around. They grow a lot of vegetables, spices and coffee. Within the farm, a small flat stretch of land has been dedicated to the camp.&lt;br />There are about a dozen canvas tents put up in semi-circular fashion over concrete slabs. In the middle of this arrangement is a pit for camp-fires with stones laid out (as Siddarth said) in the Stone Henge pattern. The camp-site overlooks the majestic western ghats hills on 3 sides and the farm land on one side. The tents have no electricity and you have to rely on kerosene laterns, which are placed in front of the tent for light.&lt;br />However, the camp doesn't actually require one to rough it out. Though the accommodation is bare bones, there are modern toilets, a well-equipped kitched, attentive staff around. Their website even mentions that there are \"rooms for the less adventurous\", however, I never saw one nor did I inquire for the same.&lt;br />We were welcomed with glasses of chilled lime water - really refreshing. Soon a late, hastily prepared breakfast of idlis, omelettes, fresh fruits and coffee was served and devoured as hastily as it was prepared. Next we went to visit the nearby stream. This was just the beginning for the rainy season and the stream was not very strong or swelling. However, we made the most of the situation and we \"boys\" jumped in and had a dip. Though the stream was dark green with moss, the water was really clean and fresh. That was our only contact with water in the 2 days that we spent there. :-) There were minor accidents - Siddharth forgot to take out his cigarrettes and matches before jumping into the stream and I almost fell off a tree I had climbed as a dead branch gave out.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;strong>&lt;u>Mr. Daniel&lt;/u>&lt;/strong>&lt;br />The farm is owned by a certain Mr. Daniel. Now, he is one interesting guy. His father was a top space scientist who was awarded a &lt;a href=\"http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?sm1=UGFkbWEgQmh1c2hhbg==&amp;fw=-1&amp;amp;fc=-1&amp;ss=0&amp;amp;es=0&amp;gwp=11&amp;amp;ver=1.0.3.109&amp;method=1\">Padma Bhushan&lt;/a> for his contribution to the Aryabhatta satellite program - which was India's first satellite. Mr. Daniel went to Allahabad Agricultural Institute and did an advanced course in Genetics, securing one of the couple of seats which were offered at the Institute. This was 20 years back. After his studies, he bought this land, which was almost unapproachable and totally wild back then. He has developed this farm on his own in the last twenty years. He is a very interesting person to talk to. One wouldn't expect a well educated fellow walking around in the wild forest, speaking Queen's English as well the local Tamil dialect with equal ease.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;strong>&lt;u>Babies' day out&lt;/u>&lt;/strong>&lt;br />The 2 babies - Chaiti and Anirudh had a field day at the camp. Though they were a little too young to enjoy the treks and the beauty, I am sure that the sense being out in the open would not have escaped them.&lt;br />&lt;a href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/img/161/5319/640/7.jpg\">&lt;img style=\"BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; MARGIN: 2px; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid\" src=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/img/161/5319/320/7.jpg\" border=\"0\" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;em>Tuli with the Kids&lt;/em>&lt;br />&lt;br />Baby Chaiti, all of 19 months had a hard time initially. First of all she had to deal with the presence of the 11-month old Anirudh who was demanding all the attention. She spent most of the day sulking away and plain ignoring the brat even as he climbed all over her, stepped on her toes, pulled at her hair. Boy, that was kinda cute - watching these basic human emotions develop so early. Wondered what was my reactions to such situations when I was a toddler.&lt;br />There was an interesting incident which highlights the unconditional caring and love only babies can possess. Chaiti, for some reason, has always been afraid of flowing water. I guess the racket of the waves or water crashing against the rocks unsettles her. Samarth, I, Siddharth and Kunal were playing in the small waterfall along the stream when Chaiti started howling, crying out \"Papa, ja; Papa, ja\"; which translated meant that she was sure that her dad is gone - swallowed by the evil waterfall which scared her so much. Samarth was forced to yield to her protests. But Chaiti commanded all of us to get away from the waterfall - she wouldn't stop crying. I was happily drying myself on a tree, when she spotted me too and cried out - \"Gullu, ba\" (Guru, bahar - get outta there now!). Boy! Do I love to hear her call me! She stopped crying as soon as we stepped out of the stream.&lt;br />Anirudh is probably one of the chubbiest babies I have ever come across so far. He is just 11 months old and \"is a complete flirt, girl of any age will do\", as his mom Mahima puts it. He kept smiling and flaunting his single lower incisors which had sprouted recently. He had a way of smiling at strangers when he was in a mood to socialize. This his mom describes his diplomatic smile as a \"Chinese smile\" and sure enough, he does looks like Fa-hien when he smiles - eyes narrowed to slits, round face, small nose. He is a cutie!&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/img/161/5319/640/Anirudh%20with%20Dad.jpg\">&lt;img style=\"BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; MARGIN: 2px; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid\" src=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/img/161/5319/320/Anirudh%20with%20Dad.jpg\" border=\"0\" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;em>Siddharth and Anirudh&lt;/em>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;strong>&lt;u>Rest of the day&lt;/u>&lt;/strong>&lt;br />After the dip and some beer, we decided to crash out and postponed the short trek downstream which was proposed. The people at the farm obliged and provided us with extra cots which they laid out under the shade of the trees at the edge of camping site, as the tents were extremely hot in the afternoon. We slept away to glory till evening. Coffee was served by our bedsides by the time we woke up. Aah - these small sinful pleasures!&lt;br />&lt;a href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/img/161/5319/640/6.jpg\">&lt;img style=\"BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; MARGIN: 2px; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid\" src=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/img/161/5319/320/6.jpg\" border=\"0\" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;em>Out in the wild &lt;/em>- &lt;em>Siddharth (with Anirudh), Me, Tikloo, Tuli (with Chaiti)&lt;/em>&lt;br />&lt;em>&lt;/em>&lt;br />By then, a large, noisy group of young professionals had arrived and were making their presence felt. Now these were a normal lot of fun-loving guys, playing and chasing each other and singing at the top of their voices - something we have done all our lives. But somehow all of us felt annoyed at the sight of them. Probably, we were feeling a little too old. :-&lt;br />As the skies darkened, the campfire was lit and the youngsters started singing and dancing around the fire and we decided to move away to a remote corner of the camping area and had a separate camp-fire lit for us.&lt;br />All of us discussed our respective college days and recalled the most stupidest things we had done or seen over a course of wine, whiskey and rum. After a round of good laughs, the babies asserted their need to be fed and put to bed and we yielded. A quick dinner followed. We then complained about the noisy group and they obliged and shut up. Pretty mean of us, but the babies were getting disturbed.&lt;br />Anyway the couples called it a day and Kunal too crashed. The noisy lot dispersed and I was left alone by the side of the smouldering camp-fire. I got my blanket along and sat for a loooong time star-gazing and in introspection. The night was so clear that I could see stars from one end of the horizon to another. The sky looked full of constellations. Unfortunately I am no authority on them. However, it is always great to lie next to a fire in the open and watch the sky. Gives one a sense of peace, a sense of humility - if one thinks about how distant, how old, how massive the tiniest of the stars are. There was no sound expect that of the crackling firewood and the cricket and foxes (or jackals) far, far away in the jungle. Peace, defined...&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;strong>&lt;u>Elephant Dung Trial&lt;/u>&lt;/strong>&lt;br />Most of us, with the exception of Tuli, broke our promise of getting up at 6 in the morning. The original plan was to go for a short walk downstream as the sun rises. However, it was 9ish by the time we finished our morning ablutions, had our coffee and prepared the babies for the day that lay ahead. Mr. Daniel sent 2 guides with us and went downstream following the elephant dung deposits. Along the way, the guide showed us the hideouts of the poachers and we spotted quite a few elephant bones. Poor creatures. The kids also enjoyed the trip - probably this was their first visit to the jungle. Unfortunately, we missed a herd of deer by minutes as they ran away because of our chattering (the kids specially were very excited).&lt;br />&lt;a href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/img/161/5319/640/4.jpg\">&lt;img style=\"BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; MARGIN: 2px; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid\" src=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/img/161/5319/320/4.jpg\" border=\"0\" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />Elephant Dung Trial&lt;br />&lt;em>&lt;br />&lt;/em>The jungle was full of the weed-like &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantana\">lantana&lt;/a> species. Siddartha mentioned that this weed is an accidental import from Australia. This species has covered most of Indian tropical forests and can prove to deadly for other plants as it consumes all resources available. This weed grows really fast. Daniel further added that there was an Indian botanist who came up with an award-winning discovery of a bug which eats lantana. This, however, proved to be little comfort because in an experimental run, these bugs were set free on a wild crop of lantana. The bugs finished the crop entirely but perished soon afterwards because there was nothing more to eat! As the bug species perished, the lantana magically grew again, thanks to some scattered seeds.&lt;br />&lt;a href=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/img/161/5319/640/5.jpg\">&lt;img style=\"BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; MARGIN: 2px; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid\" src=\"http://photos1.blogger.com/img/161/5319/320/5.jpg\" border=\"0\" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;em>Tuli Me and Chaiti&lt;br />&lt;/em>&lt;strong>&lt;u>The return&lt;/u>&lt;/strong>&lt;br />Breakfast followed the short hike in the woods and we packed our stuff, paid the bills and set off to Bangalore. We thanked Daniel for his help and Samarth asked him if he expected any more guests today. \"No,\" came the reply, \"the weekend's over. Through the week we are just farmers\"...&lt;br />It was not one of the most lavish places I have been to. But what's appealling about the place is its honesty. There is no landscaping, no forced eco-friendly stuff, no ultra-trimmed grass, no room service. It is nature just as it is - slightly tamed to make it easier to handle. The food was plain but tasty. The service was excellent. Overall it was an excellent experience, more so because of the great company. All thanks to Samarth for arranging this. And here's wishing Tuli and Samarth a very happy anniversary!&lt;br />Yet to develop and scan the snaps - will upload them as soon as I do."},

These people love sports and anyone who knows me  would immediately ask how it is that I could be related to them. In any case, I  am, and it happens that Marcos Baghdatis (the brother of a former classmate of  mine from Cyprus) is doing exceptionally well in the Australian Open. Not that  people have ever needed a reason to talk about sports but the rarity of a  Cypriot being in the final rounds of any major sporting event is of utmost  national importance and begs for conversation.&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/DIV> &lt;DIV>&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2>&lt;SPAN  class=301543508-27012006>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/FONT>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV> &lt;DIV>&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2>&lt;SPAN class=301543508-27012006>I think the  conversation was somehow connected to both the tennis and the soccer when my  mum's cousin said \"Sport brings people together and their differences don't  matter\". I thought about this statement for quite some time. I remembered the  national flags the people waved around, the colours, the attitudes, the remarks  that sports commentators made about players and the audience, the fans chanting,  the confrontations, who was/wasn't considered a \"real fan\" and all the other  wonders that accompany the world of sports interest. Differences don't  matter?&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/DIV> &lt;DIV>&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2>&lt;SPAN  class=301543508-27012006>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/FONT>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV> &lt;DIV>&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2>&lt;SPAN class=301543508-27012006>My father told me  that at the end of one of Marcos' earlier games&amp;nbsp;the media interviewed his  father. The fans in the background were&amp;nbsp;screaming nationalist&amp;nbsp;chants  about the Turks getting out of Cyprus (in greek of course) and the commentator  asked his father \"what are they saying?\" to which he responded something along  the lines of \"... that Marcos is the best and they believe he will definitely  win\". This is actually quite a complicated situation to try to make sense of.  Nationalist sentiments are so intricately connected to various aspects of  identity and how this is uttered and (re-/per-/con-)ceived is a whole other  story.&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/DIV> &lt;DIV>&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2>&lt;SPAN  class=301543508-27012006>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/FONT>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV> &lt;DIV>&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2>&lt;SPAN class=301543508-27012006>Why did they choose  to foreground their nationalist ideologies at this sports event?

So sport might  bring certain people together but most of the time I would argue it makes  unequal divisions in our societies even more acute by drawing on how our  differences have been constructed.&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/DIV> &lt;DIV>&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2>&lt;SPAN  class=301543508-27012006>&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/FONT>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV> &lt;DIV>&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2>&lt;SPAN class=301543508-27012006>Now let's see if  sending this email actually posts this on my  blog!&lt;/SPAN>&lt;/FONT>&lt;/DIV>"},

It always felt like you are talking to a computer or my mathematics teacher, neither of which you could get a straight answer out of. Now that I think of it make that any answer out of...&lt;br />&lt;br />After some failed (I call it failed as no one would read them even if I paid for it) attempts at blogging I could figure out one plain, bare fact. My English sucked !! The grammar and sentence formation was appaling. The usage had the finese and intelligence of a 4 year old kid from the wambusi tribe who had just seen how to make fire by banging(I hope you do realise that i use the word banging in a moment of intellectual starvation and sorely for the want of a better subtituition) two stones (Stones is just fine as any other word, dont think too much about it).&lt;br />&lt;br />Despite all this confusing thoughts I shall soldier on and complete this post for two main purposes ..&lt;br />&lt;br />Firstly I have always harbored this desire to be an author, again a pursuit which has witnessed many a heroic effort and equally tragic and immensely forgettable failures. My Cunning plan is as follows. Through blogging build up my diction sufficiently to be able to articulate the thoughts in my brain in a manner that would do justice to my magnificent and dare I say wonderfully gifted imagination. Phase 2: Author a children's novel that will unseat the mighty Noddy and having done that sky is truly the limit..... You acn book your copies now by calling the toll free number 1600-420-4200&lt;br />&lt;br />The second pupose , update on life or atleast the part of life fit to be shared publicly. Match rained out so that suddenly floods me with 8 more hours to do something. A luxury I could have well avoided. Dad's Bday today so will probably have a small celebration at home later..... You know i actually do more coller stuff but i dont want to make you people jealous, so i am leaving all that out.&lt;br />&lt;br />I think thats quite enough for the day a non standard disclaimer to finish \"All incorrect usages are deliberate and used just to add humourousness\". If you dont get some parts just laugh aloud and no one will know that you didnt understand.......&lt;br />&lt;br />Hmmmmm.... now that all this is over i am actually thinking of why i agve this title? Maybe something on it next time....."},

Between going back to Canada for Christmas, starting 2 university courses part-time, and going out with friends it seems like every night, been really busy recently!!&lt;br />&lt;br />Christmas in Canada was great, the weather was about the same as it was in Nagoya. Great catching up with the family, although it took a while to realize that I could understand everything around me language-wise, and that everyone could understand me. Except for the guy at the Starbucks on Robson Street in Vancouver, not sure what was up with him!! Certainly gives me a newer perspective on living in Japan. Things that really used to irritate me (like really terrible tv commercials, what are the Gulliver people thinking?!!) seem not as bad now, after seeing endless dumb cleaning product ads on Canadian television!! There does still seem to be a lack of logic a lot of the time here though. For instance, recently the UFJ bank machines have an alternate language option, so you can do a deposit or withdrawal in English, Chinese, Korean, or Portuguese. Makes sense to me, as there is a decent amount of people who live here who speak those languages as a mother tongue. However, a friend pointed out that it is probably just a promotional thing happening while Expo is going on, and that when Expo disappears, so will the other languages. I don't understand why, as they've already done all the hard work doing the programming and stuff! It's not like there's a little guy sitting in the machine, translating away! Another thing that doesn't make sense is that bank machines in Japan close at night and on the weekends. You can't get any money out except during banking hours. I knew about that before I got my bank account, which is why I am with UFJ bank, they actually have 24/7 bank machines. However, they sometimes have them in little booths that are only accessible during banking hours, the rest of the time they are locked! Huh????? I am slowly learning that the worst question to ask about anything in Japan is \"Why?\". Either there isn't an answer, or it's something like \"It's always been done this way, so that's the only way it can be done\". I'm trying not to pay attention to stuff like that, or else I would go nutty! Well, I already am a little nutty, so maybe too late!!&lt;br />&lt;br />Went to Kyoto last week with some friends from work, it was great going back there. I haven't been back since I left to move to Nagoya, so it was nice seeing it again. I just love the temples, and I love the scenery and cute little shops in Gion. It was nice being able to actually appreciate the city. When I was living there last year, I was trying to be really careful with my money, as I didn't know when or if I would get a job. So, I didn't go into stores and such, as I knew I would just be too tempted to buy things. There are some really beautiful things in those little stores, some of them just look like someone's house, until you walk in and see stuff for sale! Through a friend, I discovered the joys of yattsuhashi - like a soft chewy pastry with filling inside. Yummy, especially the choco-banana variety!! The traditional ones are nice too, but choco-banana rocks!! Also, when I was living in Kyoto last year, I was very culture-shocked, which really affected how I saw the city. It was nice going back, now that I am basically acclimatized to Japan. It was a beautiful day, even though it was a little cold. The photo of the painting was at Kitanotenmangu shrine, and an old guy there said it was about 300 years old. Very cool!! The detail of one of the shrine buildings is from the same place.&lt;br />&lt;br />Teaching going ok, but right now we are deciding on which kids go up to the next level in April, which ones stay, etc etc. My boss is totally stressed!! Most of the kids are nice, but it seems like a lot of them don't get any discipline at home, which carries over into the classroom. They're smacking you and telling you to shut up, and the mothers are just sitting there going, \"Isn't my child so cute!!\". No honey, not cute. Either that, or they're terrified of their mum and are so quiet they kind of freak you out. Luckily, compared to some of the kids the other teachers have, most of mine are relatively well-behaved. I think I'll be able to teach for a few more years without losing my marbles, but that's why I'm doing some university courses from New Zealand, to give me some options later. Studying towards a BA in Politics, taking World History since 1900 and Politics at the moment. I hope one day to work for the Canadian or NZ government doing counter-terrorism work. Endlessly challenging and interesting!&lt;br />&lt;br />So, life in Japan is proving to still be interesting, if at times befuddling. But, as I just found out, I passed my level 3 (sankyuu) JLPT test, which is great, and at least gives me hope that one day I'll actually be able to communicate! My boyfriend keeps trying to get me to speak in Japanese, but my vocab is so low that it's really difficult. A friend suggested I start studying the kids cram school (juku) books, so that's what I'm doing now. Just started with the grade 1 book, and it's proving really useful for learning new vocab and practicing kanji. I now know the Japanese for lumberjack, sunflower, and woodpecker - I know, they will be terribly useful in everyday life! I certainly get some strange looks on the train, studying using a grade 1 kids book!! Good practice though, and then I can go up level by level, and actually start to read stuff like books and such. The only thing I can read at the moment is stuff designed for foreigners learning Japanese. Interesting, but not exactly the kind of stuff that I would find in daily life, or that will help me learn grammar and vocab easier. I love reading, and I figure if I can get to the point where I can read stories and such, then I can just start to absorb the grammar and vocab that way, like you do when you are learning your own language. &lt;br />&lt;br />So who knows when my next post will be, but I'll try to make it more than one or twice a season!!"},

MD5 produces a hash that is 128 bits long and&lt;br />that is commonly written as sequence of 32 hexadecimal (base 16) digits.&lt;br />If you were to take my name and process it with MD5, you would get this&lt;br />seemingly random string:&lt;br />&lt;br />c55bbe0f3ba258f5b1cb6d5b62b0b360&lt;br />&lt;br />Or, to state it with more mathematical formality:&lt;br />&lt;br />MD5(?Simson Garfinkel?)= c55bbe0f3ba258f5b1cb6d5b62b0b360&lt;br />&lt;br />Each of those hexadecimal characters represents 4 bits; the MD5 value of&lt;br />my name is actually:&lt;br />&lt;br />1100010101011011101111100000111100111011101&lt;br />0001001011000111101011011000111001011011011&lt;br />010101101101100010101100001011001101100000&lt;br />&lt;br />Most people work with the hexadecimal representation because it?s pretty&lt;br />easy to look two hashes and tell if they are the same or different.&lt;br />&lt;br />MD5 works by splitting the file up into lots of small pieces, and then&lt;br />taking each of those chunks and performing hundreds of mathematical&lt;br />operations that shuffle, invert, transpose, and otherwise process the&lt;br />bits into an unrecognizable mess. The word ?unrecognizable? in this&lt;br />description is key. The fundamental requirement of a good hash function&lt;br />is that it should be impossible to predict the fingerprint of a file&lt;br />without actually going to the effort of computing that fingerprint&lt;br />?there must be no short-cuts. If there were, you might be able to run&lt;br />the hash function backwards and create a file that had a specific&lt;br />hash?for example, the hash of another file. Indeed, the entire security&lt;br />of hash functions falls apart utterly if it is possible to generate two&lt;br />files that have the same hash.&lt;br />&lt;br />The beauty of the hash function is that even a tiny modification to the&lt;br />input produces a dramatic change in the output. Mathematically, the&lt;br />functions are designed so that every bit in the output will have a 50&lt;br />percent chance of changing for every single bit changed in the input.&lt;br />&lt;br />Let?s look at another MD5 hash, this one of a slightly different&lt;br />representation of my name:&lt;br />&lt;br />MD5(?Simson L. Garfinkel?)= df876e8e6f548d5be698fab7f06dd278&lt;br />&lt;br />Merely adding \"L.\" produces a completely different hash. If you compare&lt;br />the two hashes bit-for-bit you?ll find that 63 out of the 128 positions&lt;br />have changed from a 0-to-1 or a 1-to-0, and the other 65 have remained&lt;br />unchanged.&lt;br />&lt;br />Unfortunately, the whole theory of cryptographic hash functions has a&lt;br />huge problem. The use of these functions requires that there be no&lt;br />so-called \"collisions\". Either accidentally or on purpose, there should&lt;br />be no two files that have the same cryptographic fingerprint. And as it&lt;br />turns out, this is an impossible requirement.&lt;br />&lt;br />The reason is pretty simple. File fingerprints are a fixed size, which&lt;br />means that there is a finite number of possible fingerprints. Files, on&lt;br />the other hand, can be any size. Thus, there are more possible files&lt;br />than fingerprints, and so there must be at least one fingerprint that is&lt;br />the fingerprint of multiple files. The mathematical term for this is the&lt;br />?pigeonhole principle.? Indeed, even if you restrict yourself to files&lt;br />that are just nine characters long, there are still 256 times the number&lt;br />of possible files as the number of possible fingerprints.&lt;br />&lt;br />The reason that the pigeonhole principle doesn?t render hash functions&lt;br />completely pointless is that there are an astounding number of possible&lt;br />fingerprints?far more, in fact, than the number of files on the planet.&lt;br />(With MD5 there are 2128 possible fingerprints. Now, the total number of&lt;br />computer hard drives that have ever been manufactured is only around&lt;br />229. If every hard drive had a million unique files?a gross&lt;br />overestimation?there would still be only 249 individual files. That?s a&lt;br />much, much, much smaller number than 2128.)&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div style=\"text-align:right\"> &lt;br />&lt;a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com\"> source: Technology Review&lt;br />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;br />"},

Well in the span of about a month we had a fire in my apartment and we were forced to move out, i've put on a little weight having been neglecting the gym and not really being able to make any food of substance without a kitchen, i had an amazing valentines day with a good friend, and classes are already kicking my ass.&lt;br />&lt;br />The fire was caused by some kinda electrical problem, and it only destroyed a few items, but it filled our entire apartment with black soot which covered all our stuff. We were forced to throw out a lot of food, and had to wash nearly everything. It took us a week of being homeless and living with friends before we were able to find a new place, which in my mind is pretty damn fast. Now we're moved into a new house which is even bigger, has a fireplace, a den, a huge garage, and a back yard. Best of all, we're paying slightly less than at the last place. Anywho it's not too bad, and it provided the perfect ambiance for my date on valentines day.&lt;br />&lt;br />Well i probably should be doing some last minute studying for my class that i have in about 15 minutes so ill cut this post short, but hopefully ill be updating soon, and god willing more often."},

I was very excited this morning D- DAY is here after so long. My TP(Traffic Police) test has finally came. I woke up super early went to ubi and waited 4 my private instructor to revise with me before i go 4 my test at 9. I went driving ard UBI and carpark ard there instead of in the circuit cuz my instructor was so smart to lost the receipt for the entry of the circuit so nv get to practice inside lorr. the time have come for me to take the test and i was all so excited and nervous. The test didn't even take 4 more den half an hr. After that i followed the TP tester into the room to get my results and i FAIL. Got 1 immediated failure fail to form up correctly and 26 demerit points which there is 10 points that is so unnecessarily deducted i mout the kerb during directional change. During my practice i nv had this problem lorr. =,( Bottom line i fial and my whole day sucks. Me here in school. Boring and another have pass."},

I had a nice few days living at the Kilmore house, because at that point I was still based at Grandma's house. On the 8th of January, Lauren had her birthday thing, so all the TKIS kids still in the district went to that. It was fun, but I was a little on edge from some things that had happened in Qld, so I needed a bit of support. Oh, and Cedrik and I, while play-fighting, managed to put a huge hole in Lauren's wall, courtesy of Cedrik's arse.&lt;br />&lt;br />The next day, Cedrik and Jess and Simon and myself scabbed a lift from Lachie's dad to the end of Jeffrey's lane to wait for the Schneiders' mother. I was sure that there was no way that she would be there soon, so we walked to my Grandma's house and waited there. Grandma wasn't home, but I figured that she wouldn't mind...and she didn't either.&lt;br />&lt;br />We drove to Porepunkah an hour or two later, and ended up spending an interesting week there. Cedrik and I had a couple of issues that needed to be worked out, but weren't by the time the holiday was over. We did some interesting things; went to a waterslide, hedgemaze, out to dinner, shopping, swimming, homework (though that isn't interesting) and generally had a good but relaxed time. I've taken to describing it as \"pleasantly uneventful.\" Anyway, Jess and I went home a week later, and very nearly missed the train...I felt very uncomfortable with Mrs. Schneider pushing 140kph along the highway.&lt;br />&lt;br />The rest of the holiday I spent hanging out, and yes, Cedrik and I did get our problems resolved so by the time I started school it was all good."},

Amazing isn\u2019t it? What a weekend lies behind me, boy oh boy! The Friday night during the last gasps of my final shift of the week, I get a call from Stefan asking me whether I want to go out with him, Reyno and Enver (our Turkish friend).&lt;span style=\"\">  &lt;/span>We started drinking a hell of a lot of alcohol in Hatfield (with the intention of getting totally splattered) and ended up at a club called Recess in &lt;st1:street>&lt;st1:address>Burnette   street&lt;/st1:address>&lt;/st1:Street> Hatfield.

I began looking at it so I could get an idea of what people are looking at.  You know - try to make more of the series people are looking for.  Unfortunately, I also keep seeing these assholes hotlinking my wallpapers as backgrounds for their blogs.  >&lt;  I can't yell at them because the picture doesn't show up anyways thanks to the hotlink protector; it doesn't take up bandwidth either.  It just annoys me to no end seeing how lazy people are.  Just... just eat shit and die.  Please?  That's all I ask.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Don't read this if you haven't seen past episode 100 of Inuyasha:&lt;/b>&lt;br />I watched about 70 episodes of Inuyasha and I still want more!! ;_;  I went all the way up to episode 155.  After that there's only 15(?) left and probably a movie.  I &lt;i>hate&lt;/i> Kikyou...  I thought she dissolved, but no - she still wanders about.  I sort of felt bad for here during her special, but that was for a second, literally.  You know for a miko she's pretty self-righteous.  Why would Inuyasha say those things to her... because he didn't - that is why.  I think the character that gets my sympathy the most in Kohaku.  At least he now remembers what he did and stayed sane.  This is progress.  Hakudoushi (older version of Naraku's baby) is really creepy.  Plus that whole Naraku... spawning a... baby - it is a little weird to me.  At least the baby part did not talk again after it was split in two.  Uck.        &lt;br />&lt;br />I really like Sesshoumaru; he's becoming a favorite and I'm not sure why.  Unfortunately I think the bad-ass factor comes into play a lot, but there's something else.  I really like how he and Rin interact.  He does talk to her much, but he's literally the family she never had.  I know he's going after Naraku because of his pride, but I think it's a little for Rin too.  Kouga has matured in the last twenty or so episodes as well.  I've gained more respect for Kouga lately.  I hope he continues this way.  I think Inuyasha has become so useless cause he's separated from the others and Naraku keeps calling time-outs.  Inuyasha and friends work best as a group, but now everyone has an individual to fight.  Plus, Naraku has called back the Shichinintai two or three times to make them stronger or put them in another location to give his side the upper hand.  Cheater.  Naraku is just a huge cheater.  I need to get Naraku a real TV with cable... instead of setting up the drama and watching unfold on the Kanna-TV.  Maybe he needs satellite instead of cable. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;marquee>&lt;font size=\"3\">&lt;b>Happy Valentine's Day to all!! &lt;3&lt;/b>&lt;/font>&lt;/marquee>&lt;br />&lt;br />Now it is time to catch up on my homework and then Naruto.  Hehehe - Naruto... I love it! Yeah, I should probably go to sleep now.  Yup."},

Those of you who know me are aware of just how long I've been waiting for this game. I currently have 865/1000G. I only need 7 more achievements and they are:&lt;br>&lt;BR>&lt;br>&lt;center>&lt;b>The Completionist&lt;/b>&lt;br>Get all expressions, pet tricks and abilities, or see another Hero do so - 50G&lt;br>&lt;i>I am currently working on this&lt;/i>&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>The Hoarder&lt;/b>&lt;br>Collect every silver key, or see another Hero do so - 25G&lt;br>&lt;i>I have to do a third playthrough to get this. So frustrating! There are two keys that if you don't get them in the beginning, you're screwed. LAME!&lt;/i>&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>The Sharpshooter&lt;/b>&lt;br>Hit three enemies with one shot, or see another Hero do so - 10G&lt;br>&lt;i>This is such a bullshit achievement. Gah!&lt;/i>&lt;br>&lt;BR>&lt;br>&lt;B>The Duellist&lt;/b>&lt;br>String together a full-speed chain attack, or see another Hero do so - 10G&lt;br>&lt;i>Bullshit&lt;/i>&lt;BR>&lt;br>&lt;BR>&lt;B>The Executioner&lt;/b>&lt;br>Sacrifice 10 ppl in Temple of Shadows, or see another Hero do so - 10G&lt;i>&lt;br>Working on it, will have it soon&lt;/i>&lt;br>&lt;BR>&lt;br>&lt;b>The Teaser&lt;/b>&lt;br>Make bandits respond to expressions with fear, anger, mirth, and confusion... during combat - 5G&lt;i>&lt;br>Will have it soon&lt;/i>&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;b>The Gargoyle&lt;/b>&lt;br>Find the gargoyles' legendary treasure - 25G&lt;br>&lt;i>I only have 15 more to find. There's a total of 50.&lt;/i>&lt;/center>&lt;BR>&lt;BR>&lt;BR>If anyone wants to help me get these, you'd be my new hero. ;) Lol&lt;br>&lt;BR>&lt;BR>&lt;BR>&lt;BR>&lt;BR>My husband likes to leave the television on Cartoon Network when he goes to bed so I have been watching Goosebumps while writing this post. Man that brings back some memories. I remember this show used to be scary, lol, now it's just lame. However, I don't see myself changing the channel; I think I like the trip down memory lane.&lt;BR>&lt;BR>&lt;BR>I've been so consumed with Fable II that I completely forgot today is Halloween. The hubby has to work but I am scrambling trying to find a haunted house nearby so we can go when he gets off. Either that or have a scary movie marathon party like we did last year. Hey, it sounds lame but it was loads of fun.&lt;br>&lt;BR>&lt;BR>&lt;img src=\"http://www.saint.org/blog/uploaded_images/happy-halloween-pumpkin-777055.JPG\">&lt;BR>Have a good one guys and gals.

Don't you find yourself asking that question more and more?&lt;br />&lt;br />We have come a long ways since our country was first founded. Religious freedom played a big part in the formation of this country. Somewhere along the way we seem to have lost track of our roots. And that is a real shame.&lt;br />&lt;br />Permissiveness, drugs, alcohol, sexual freedom and much more has led the the complete moral decay of a once great country. As we added so much to our historic legacy with the industrial revolution, the space age and greater things we have lost track of our heritage. What made us really great was our religious beliefs. Now we burn churches and worship idols. We could have become even greater and stronger but we chose the easy path. A path of destruction.&lt;br />&lt;br />Where will it lead us? Only God knows the answer to that. But I would recommend that when that time comes you should be ready. Repent and be saved. God forgives even the worst of sinners. He gave his life on the cross for our sins. He gave his life because he cared for us. Now it is our turn to come back to the cross and ask for forgiveness for our sins."},

Of course, I would like her to debut at #1 if possible, but four consecutive #1 albums and five consecutive Top 5 album is an amazing feat. It's a record that will be very difficult to break. "},

Recently when a friend of mine explained how he is now with a married woman it kind of put so many things in perspective.  I was upset when he told me, not because what I thought he was doing was wrong, but the fact that he (for many years) portrayed himself to me as something that he is definetly not.  Why I'm saying all this is that, it made me move away from all of that and concentrate of the people who really care about me.

Since the weather has gotten much colder the price dropped dramatically in a matter of one week, in one weeks time gas dropped 50 cents a gallon and right now it is 2.05 a gallon!&lt;br />&lt;br />It makes me wonder if the fuel compaines and the natural gas compaines don't get totgether and say ok now that the colder weather is here, you the natural gas company can now rake in the profits and once the weather gets warmer the natural gas companies say ok fuel comapines now it is your turn to make money.&lt;br />&lt;br />Just a little info on natural gas average cost per 1000 feet is $14.99!!!!&lt;br />&lt;br />  Give me a break!!!! I though natural gas was the most abundant resource in the U.S.!!!  Now all of sudden we are in a crisis!  Let's balme the prices on the Hurricans that have hit the Gulf of Mexico, but isn't it funny that theser prices were still this high before Katrina hit?&lt;br />&lt;br />Hey George Bush get off your lame Fema appointing ass and do something abou the price of natural gas and fuel.  Oh wait I forgot you are a complete idiotsaying thatthe economy is strong with all of these new jobs, I d not consider working at Wall Mart to be a viable source of income.  Douhh!!!!!!"},
